* Dvorak

The dvorak keyboard layout is really advantageous to those of us who
write emails all day (read: me). However, it does create some problem
with things like =C-x= in Emacs. In dvorak, =x= is =b= on the
keyboard, meaning you're reaching quite far with your hand.

I'm going to try out switching =C-t= and =C-x= as per suggested by [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_dvorak_C-x.html][Xah
Lee's page]] on the dvorak =C-x= problem.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (keyboard-translate ?\C-x ?\C-t)
  (keyboard-translate ?\C-t ?\C-x)
#+end_src

Also, let's get angry about using C-x until I'm used to it actually being C-t.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key
   (kbd "C-t") 
   (lambda ()
     (interactive)
     (run-with-timer 
      0.3 nil 
      (lambda ()
        ;; Assuming these are the default values
        (setq visible-bell nil)
        (setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)))
     (setq visible-bell t)
     (setq ring-bell-function nil)
     (error "Don't press that button.")))
#+end_src
