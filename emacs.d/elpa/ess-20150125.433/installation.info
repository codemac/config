This is installation.info, produced by makeinfo version 5.2 from
installation.texi.

  1. Download the latest zip or tgz archive from ESS downloads area
     (http://ess.r-project.org/index.php?Section=download) and unpack it
     into a directory where you would like ESS to reside.  We will
     denote this directory as '/path/to/ESS/' hereafter.

     Alternatively you can use 'svn' or 'git' to fetch the most recent
     development version to your local machine with:

          svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk /path/to/ESS

     or

          git clone https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS.git /path/to/ESS

  2. Optionally, compile elisp files and build the documentation with:
          cd /path/to/ESS/
          make
     Without this step, info, pdf and html documentation and reference
     card will not be available.

  3. Optionally, install into your local machine with 'make install'.
     You might need administrative privileges:

          make install

     The files are installed into '/usr/share/emacs' directory.  For
     this step to run correctly on Mac OS X, you will need to adjust the
     'PREFIX' path in 'Makeconf'.  The necessary code and instructions
     are commented in that file.

  4. If you have performed the 'make install' step from above, just add

          (require 'ess-site)

     to your '~/.emacs' file.  Otherwise, you should add
     '/path/to/ESS/lisp/' to your emacs load path and then load ESS with
     the following lines in your '~/.emacs':

          (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ESS/lisp/")
          (load "ess-site")

  5. Restart your Emacs and check that ESS was loaded from a correct
     location with 'M-x ess-version'.

   _Note for Windows and Mac OS X users:_ The most straightforward way
to install Emacs on your machine is by downloading all-in-one
(http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs/) Emacs binary by Vincent Goulet.

   _Note for XEmacs users:_ Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS
requires, ESS support of XEmacs ends with ESS 12.04-4.  This decision
will be re-visited in the future as XEmacs continues to sync with GNU
Emacs.
