;;; Commentary:
;;; This file contains the BBDB interface to Supercite (sc)
;;; See bbdb.texinfo for documentation.

;;; This file was written by Martin Sjolin <marsj@ida.liu.se>
;;; based on the original code by Tom Tromey <tromey@busco.lanl.gov>.
;;;
;;; Thanks to Richard Stanton <stanton@haas.berkeley.edu> for ideas
;;; for improvements and to Michael D. Carney  <carney@ltx-tr.com>
;;; for testing and feedback.

;;; This file adds the ability to define attributions for Supercite in BBDB
;;; and it enables you to retrieve your standard attribution from BBDB.
;;; You need Supercite to make this code work.
;;;
;;; If the From header in the mail to which you are replying only contains
;;; the mail address, the personal name is looked up in BBDB.  The attribution
;;; is stored under the key `attribution' (unless you have changed
;;; `bbdb/sc-attribution-field').

;;; To use this code add "sc-consult" to `sc-preferred-attribution-list', e.g.,
;;;
;;;   (setq sc-preferred-attribution-list
;;;         '("sc-lastchoice" "x-attribution" "sc-consult"
;;;           "initials" "firstname" "lastname"))
;;;
;;; The variable `sc-attrib-selection-list' must include an expression as below:
;;;
;;;   (add-to-list 'sc-attrib-selection-list
;;;                '("sc-from-address"
;;;                  ((".*" . (bbdb/sc-consult-attr
;;;                            (sc-mail-field "sc-from-address"))))))
;;;
;;; And finally we set the `sc-mail-glom-frame' to enable the
;;; fetching of the name of person when there is only an mail
;;; address in the original mail, e.g.,
;;;
;;;   (setq sc-mail-glom-frame
;;;         '((begin                        (setq sc-mail-headers-start (point)))
;;;           ("^From "                     (sc-mail-check-from) nil nil)
;;;           ("^x-attribution:[ \t]+.*$"   (sc-mail-fetch-field t) nil t)
;;;           ("^\\S +:.*$"                 (sc-mail-fetch-field) nil t)
;;;           ("^$"                         (progn (bbdb/sc-default)
;;;                                                (list 'abort '(step . 0))))
;;;           ("^[ \t]+"                    (sc-mail-append-field))
;;;           (sc-mail-warn-if-non-rfc822-p (sc-mail-error-in-mail-field))
;;;           (end                          (setq sc-mail-headers-end (point)))))
