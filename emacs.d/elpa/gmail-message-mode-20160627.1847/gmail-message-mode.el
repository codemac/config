;;; Commentary:
;;
;; gmail-message-mode
;; ==========
;;
;; **gmail-message-mode** is an emacs major-mode for editing gmail
;; messages using markdown syntax, it is meant for use with browser
;; plugins which allow you to edit text fields with external applications
;; (in this case, emacs). See [Plugins][] below for a list for each
;; browser.
;;
;; **The problem:** Lately, gmail messages have been demanding html. That
;;   made it very hard to edit them outside your browser, because you had
;;   to edit html source code (for instance, linebreaks were ignored and
;;   you had to type `<br>' instead).
;;
;; **gmail-message-mode to the rescue:** Simply activate this mode in
;;   gmail messages (See [Activation][]); the buffer is converted to
;;   markdown and you may edit at will, but the file is still saved as
;;   html behind the scenes so GMail won't know a thing! *See
;;   [ham-mode][1] to understand how this works.*
;;
;; Activation
;; ----------
;; Make sure you install it:
;;
;;     M-x package-install RET gmail-message-mode
;;
;; And that's it!
;; *(if you install manually, note that it depends on [ham-mode][1])*
;;
;; This package will (using `auto-mode-alist') configure emacs to
;; activate `gmail-message-mode' whenever you're editing a file that
;; seems to be a gmail message. However, given the wide range of possible
;; plugins, it's hard to catch them all. You may have to add entries
;; manually to `auto-mode-alist', to make sure `gmail-message-mode' is
;; activated.
;;
;; ## Plugins ##
;;
;; 1. **Google-Chrome or Chromium** - [Edit with emacs][]
;; 2. **Conkeror** - [Spawn Helper (built-in)][]
;; 3. **Firefox** - Used to work with [It's all text][]. See [this thread][] for a hacky workaround.
