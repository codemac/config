#+TITLE: Ox-tufte
#+AUTHOR: The Bayesians Inc.

* Introduction
[[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][Tufte CSS]] has visually appealing defaults for webpages and supports (among other
things) margin and side notes. Unfortunately, /Tufte CSS/ makes a number of
demands of the HTML structure. This is a pity, because the HTML generated by
=ox-html= breaks some of those assumptions (of =tufte-css=). Using =ox-tufte=
you can avail the features of =tufte-css= when exporting an org-mode file to
HTML. Since version 2+, the design goal of =ox-tufte= has been to *minimally*
change the HTML structure generated by =ox-html= (with additional CSS as needed)
to get behaviour that is equivalent to =tufte-css=.

=ox-tufte= tries very hard to not introduce additional constraints (over and
above those imposed by =ox-html= and =tufte-css=) for users. In fact, work on
=ox-tufte= [[https://github.com/ox-tufte/ox-tufte/milestone/1][version 2]] began after noticing that:
- =ox-tufte= was broken and didn't faithfully reproduce the =tufte-css=
  experience.
- [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/org-tufte][org-tufte]] made additional assumptions and was too opinionated. E.g.,
  - deviations from =ox-html=
    - [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/org-tufte/blob/404ab1286139ea6cbdc00bb1fb50a0afd9d067de/org-tufte.el#L102][use of katex instead of mathjax]]
    - [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/org-tufte/blob/404ab1286139ea6cbdc00bb1fb50a0afd9d067de/org-tufte.el#L87][modified html-template]]
  - [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/org-tufte/blob/404ab1286139ea6cbdc00bb1fb50a0afd9d067de/org-tufte.el#L97][automated inclusion of css hosted at third-party location]]

=ox-tufte= is still a work-in-progress, but it is being used by at least [[https://weary_travelers.gitlab.io/][one
blog]] in "production". Please open an issue if you discover any bugs!
** Compatibility
Ox-tufte is compatible and tested with
- =tufte-css= [[https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/releases/tag/v1.8.0][v1.8.0]]
- =org-mode= >= 9.5
- =emacs= >= 27.1

It's worth noting that Emacs 27.1 comes with Org version 9.3 (Org version 9.5
comes with Emacs 28.1), however, it can be updated via Emacs's "package menu"
(M-x list-packages).

Please open issues if you discover any incompatibility!
* Installation and Usage
You can install ox-tufte using [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

(package-refresh-contents)
(package-install 'ox-tufte)
#+END_SRC

And then in your ~init.el~ (or equivalent):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-tufte)
  (ox-tufte-init)
#+END_SRC

It's important that you download [[https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css][tufte css]] ([[https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/releases/tag/v1.8.0][v1.8.0]]) and place it on your server
(with the fonts).

** Usage
The recommended way to use =ox-tufte= is *with* [[https://orgmode.org/manual/CSS-support.html][the default style provided by
ox-html]]. Include =tufte.css= followed by =src/ox-tufte.css= (strictly in that
order) in your org-mode document. This can be done by setting [[https://github.com/emacs-straight/org-mode/blob/ca873f7fe47546bca19821f1578a6ab95bf5351c/lisp/ox-html.el#L134][the =:html-head=
option for ox-html]]. This can be done in elisp, or done in the specific
org-mode document by adding a header such as:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/tufte.css" type="text/css" />
  ,#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/ox-tufte.css" type="text/css" />
#+END_SRC

For usage, when exporting simply select "Tufte HTML" instead of regular HTML
export from the export menu (=C-c C-e=).
* Features
ox-tufte supports *most* of the features from tufte-css, some in different ways
than expected, and some extensions.

** [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#sidenotes][Sidenotes and margin-notes]]
- <<footnotes>>Org-mode footnotes become numbered Sidenotes from the tufte spec

<<marginnotes-inline>>"Inline" margin-notes (i.e., margin-notes that can include
[[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#phrasing-content-2][HTML phrasing content]]) are implemented as an inline babel call, specifically, to
[[marginnote][the "marginnote" block defined below]].
#+name: marginnote
#+header: :var input=""
#+begin_src elisp :exports results :results html replace value
  (require 'ox-tufte)
  (ox-tufte--utils-margin-note input)
#+end_src
The usage is as follows:
#+begin_src org
  This is some regular text call_marginnote("this will be a margin note") and some
  more text call_marginnote("another margin note").
#+end_src
See [[deprecated-margin-notes][deprecation sub-section below]] regarding the alternate syntax for inline
margin-notes (which is now deprecated).

There is also support for "block" margin-notes, which are margin-notes that can
contain "block" elements ([[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#flow-content-2][HTML spec flow content]]) such as paragraphs, lists,
tables etc. These are defined using an org-mode "marginnote" special-block
(i.e., within =#+begin_marginnote= and =#+end_marginnote=, or within
=#+BEGIN_marginnote= and =#+END_marginnote=).
#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_marginnote
  This is a block level margin-note.
  - item 1
  - item 2
  ,#+end_marginnote
#+end_src

*** <<deprecated-margin-notes>>Deprecated: Margin-notes as links
Previously, =ox-tufte= encoded margin-notes as links. Said syntax is now
deprecated and support for it will be dropped in future versions. This syntax is
limiting since, in org, [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html#orgd10b2cd][link descriptions cannot contain regular links]].

- The margin note number is optional and either `mn:1` or `mn:` as below would
  work:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  This is some regular text [[mn:1][this will be a margin note]] and some more
  text [[mn:][another margin note]].
#+END_SRC

** <<epigraphs>>[[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#epigraphs][Epigraphs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Paragraphs.html#index-BEGIN_005fVERSE][quotes]]
- Anything within =#+begin_epigraph= and =#+end_epigraph= becomes an epigraph
  (which is a collection of one or more quoted blocks). For example:
  #+begin_src org
    ,#+begin_epigraph
    ,#+name: quote-1
    ,#+caption: Richard P. Feynman, @@html:<cite>“What Do You Care What Other People Think?”</cite>@@
    ,#+begin_quote
    For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations,
    for Nature cannot be fooled.
    ,#+end_quote

    ,#+name: quote-2
    ,#+caption: Henri Matisse, @@html:<cite>Henri Matisse Dessins: thèmes et variations</cite>@@ (Paris, 1943), 37
    ,#+begin_quote
    I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.
    ,#+end_quote
    ,#+end_epigraph
  #+end_src
- =ox-tufte= also adds support for =#+CAPTION= on [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Paragraphs.html#index-BEGIN_005fVERSE][org-mode =quote= and =verse= blocks]].
** <<code>>[[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#code][Code]]
=ox-tufte= uses =ox-html= to export [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html][code fragments]] to HTML (without any
alteration). =ox-html= and [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/htmlize.html][=htmlize=]] allow one to customize the syntax
highlighting of the exported code blocks. An Emacs color theme that is visually
consistent with =tufte-css= is the [[https://melpa.org/#/plan9-theme][=plan9-theme=]] which can be installed from
Melpa via something like:
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'plan9-theme)
#+end_src
And then in your =init.el= or equivalent, load it using:
src_elisp{(load-theme 'plan9 t)}.
** <<figures>>Figures and iframes
To use =tufte-css='s =iframe-wrapper= class, one can do something like below:
#+begin_src org
  ,#+ATTR_HTML: :class iframe-wrapper
  ,#+begin_figure
  @@html:<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YslQ2625TR4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>@@
  ,#+end_figure
#+end_src

To have fullwidth figures:
#+begin_src org
  ,#+ATTR_HTML: :class fullwidth
  ,#+CAPTION: Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From Beautiful Evidence, page 122-124.
  [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/img/napoleons-march.png]]
  ,#+end_figure
#+end_src
** <<quilts>>ImageQuilts
=tufte-css= has a notion of image quilts. [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#imagequilts][the examples on tufte-css website]] are
single images that were created by combining multiple images. However, that
processing was done before linking via html. It's unclear what, if any,
conveniences =tufte-css= provides for image quilts (over and above other
features, since [[figures][single images can already be included as desired]]).

However, in =ox-tufte= one can create a figure with multiple images.
#+begin_src org
  ,#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <style> .quiltish img { max-height: 200px; min-height: 100px; } </style>
  ,#+attr_html: :class quiltish
  ,#+CAPTION: caption for multiple images
  ,#+begin_figure
  [[./path/to/img1.png]]
  [[./path/to/img2.png]]
  ,#+end_figure
#+end_src
** Deviations and Extensions (from =tufte-css= and =ox-html=)
*** Sections and Headings
- =h4= heading level is supported in a consistent manner similar to =h3=.
*** Epigraphs
Epigraphs and quotes by default occupy only the width of the main content. In
order to get quoted content that extends for the fullwidth add the =fullwidth=
class with an =#+attr_html= annotation.
*** Sidenotes and margin-notes
- =tufte-css= numbers sidenotes via CSS and as such referring to the same
  sidenote more than once results in erroneous numbering. =ox-tufte= fixes
  this.
- Block margin-notes are supported via src_org{#+begin_marginnote} and
  src_org{#+end_marginnote}.
*** Figures
- Captions on images are placed below the image (as opposed to in the margin
  area) regardless of whether the image is =fullwidth= or not.
*** Code
- Since code blocks cannot have footnotes/sidenotes in them, they are treated as
  if they were using the "fullwidth" class (without having to specify the class
  via =#+attr_html=).
*** ImageQuilts
- Unlike =ox-html=, in =ox-tufte= captions on figure special-blocks (the kind
  used when including multiple images in a block, as in ImageQuilts) are
  included as figcaptions. *Limitation:* presently the included caption doesn't
  include automated numbering.
** Experimental
There may be some experimental extensions in =src/ox-tufte-experimental.css=.
If desired, this css file should be included /after/ =src/ox-tufte.css=.
* Limitations
- Code blocks (multiline) currently behave /only/ in a "fullwidth" manner. I.e.,
  if there is sidenote content from previous paragraph, or a block margin-note
  it will push the code block down.
- Footnotes/sidenotes cannot contain nested footnotes/sidenotes.

Additionally, =ox-tufte= presently inherits the following limitations from
[[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][tufte-css]]:
- Sidenotes cannot contain paragraphs, tables etc. (since they are HTML =span=
  elements).
- Captions for =iframe-wrapper= blocks aren't supported.
* Customization
** Footnotes section at bottom
The behaviour depends on the value of
~org-tufte-include-footnotes-at-bottom~. Because footnotes are transformed to
sidenotes they are currently hidden on very narrow screens (like phones), unless
the use manually toggles visibility for each reference. if you want to include
footnodes *also* at the bottom of the page, this may be set to =t= using either
=setq= (src_elisp{(setq org-tufte-include-footnotes-at-bottom t)}), or, more
conveniently, during initial setup by passing =t= to =ox-tufte-init=:
#+begin_src elisp
  (ox-tufte-init t)
#+end_src

This behaviour can also be configured on a per-file basis
(assuming =org-export-allow-bind-keywords= is =t=) using below:
#+begin_src org
  ,#+BIND: org-tufte-include-footnotes-at-bottom nil
#+end_src
** Margin-note symbol and visibility on small screens
From [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][tufte-css]]:
#+begin_quote
However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its
viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document
currently uses the symbol ⊕ (&#8853;), but it’s up to you.
#+end_quote
This symbol can be tweaked, by modifying the value of
=org-tufte-margin-note-symbol=. Specifically, if this value is set to the empty
string (=""=), then margin-notes are always hidden on small screens.
** Color of margin-note visibility-toggle and footnote-references
Margin-note visibility color toggle can be tweaked using something like
#+begin_src css
  label.margin-toggle {
      color: #a00000;
  }
#+end_src

For footnote references, something like below would work
#+begin_src css
  label.sidenote-number,
  .sidenote > sup.numeral {
      color: #a00000;
  }
#+end_src
