Olivetti is a simple Emacs minor mode for a nice writing environment.

Features
--------

- Set a desired text body width to automatically resize window margins
  to keep the text comfortably in the middle of the window.
- Text body width can be the number of characters (an integer) or a
  fraction of the window width (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).
- Interactively change body width with:
  `olivetti-shrink` C-c [ [ [ ...
  `olivetti-expand` C-c ] ] ] ...
  `olivetti-set-width` C-c \
- If `olivetti-body-width` is an integer, the text body width will scale
  with use of `text-scale-mode`, whereas if a fraction (float) then the
  text body width will remain at that fraction.
- Optionally remember the state of `visual-line-mode` on entry and
  recall its state on exit.
- Optionally hide the mode-line for distraction-free writing.

Olivetti keeps everything it does buffer-local, so you can write prose in one
buffer and code in another, side-by-side in the same frame. Or, by hiding the
mode-line and using a single window in a fullscreen frame, Olivetti provides a
nice distraction-free environment. For those looking for a hardcore
distraction-free writing mode with a much larger scope, I recommend
[writeroom-mode].

Requirements
------------

- Emacs 24.4

Installation
------------

Olivetti is available through [MELPA] and [MELPA-stable]. I
encourage installing the stable version.

Alternately, download the [latest release] and put it in your
`load-path`.

Known Bugs
----------

- `linum-mode` in Emacs versions earlier than 26.1 has a bug that overwrites
  margin settings, making it incompatible with modes that work with margins.

Hints
-----

To always use a different width for a specific file, set a [File Variable]
specifying `olivetti-body-width`:

    M-x add-file-local-variable RET olivetti-body-width RET 66 RET
