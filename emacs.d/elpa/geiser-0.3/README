Geiser is a generic Emacs/Scheme interaction mode, featuring an
enhanced REPL and a set of minor modes improving Emacs' basic scheme
major mode.

Geiser supports Racket and Guile.

Main functionalities:

    - Evaluation of forms in the namespace of the current module.

    - Macro expansion.

    - File/module loading.

    - Namespace-aware identifier completion (including local bindings,
      names visible in the current module, and module names).

    - Autodoc: the echo area shows information about the signature of
      the procedure/macro around point automatically.

    - Jump to definition of identifier at point.

    - Direct access to documentation, including docstrings (when the
      implementation provides them) and user manuals.

    - Listings of identifiers exported by a given module (Guile).

    - Listings of callers/callees of procedures (Guile).

    - Rudimentary support for debugging (list of
      evaluation/compilation error in an Emacs' compilation-mode
      buffer).

    - Support for inline images in schemes, such as Racket, that treat
      them as first order values.
