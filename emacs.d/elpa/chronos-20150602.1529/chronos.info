1 Introduction
**************

Chronos provides multiple countdown / countup timers, updated every
second, shown sorted by expiry time in the special buffer *chronos*.

   The *chronos* buffer might look like:

         Expiry      Elapsed      To go  Message
         [17:02]                         --now--
         [17:07]           9       4:51  Coffee

   In this example, the time 'now' is 17:02. A five minute countdown
timer was set up 9 seconds ago.  It is expected to expire in 4 minutes
51 seconds at 17:07.

1.1 Motivation
==============

There are a number of Emacs packages that provide timer
functionality, such as job tracking, alarms or a countdown timer in
the mode line.  However, I wanted one that showed multiple
simultaneous countdown and countup timers in a specific buffer.

   Possible use cases include:

   * Cooking timers (what I use it for most often).

   * Presentation timers (when to start wrapping up, when to start
     questions etc.).

   * Timing how long something takes (on a scale of seconds to hours).

2 Installation and quick start
******************************

2.1 Installation
================

Put chronos.el somewhere Emacs can find it and run `(require
'chronos)'.

   Alternatively, if you have set up:
   * MELPA http://melpa.org/#/getting-started, you can install using
     `M-x package-install chronos'.

   * MELPA and `use-package' https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package,
     you can install by evaluating `(use-package chronos :ensure t)',
     and adding that snippet to your init file if you want chronos
     for future sessions.

   No configuration is required, but see *note Configuration::.

2.1.1 Dependencies
------------------

Chronos should work on a stock Emacs install.

   When a timer expires, the hook `chronos-expiry-functions' is run
with the expired timer as an argument so that the user can be notified
in various ways.  Some of the standard notification functions you can
use require e.g. Emacs to be built with certain features like audio
support, or particular system environments.  For details, see *note
Notifications::.

2.1.2 Enhancements
------------------

There is a helm interface for conveniently adding timers,
`helm-chronos'.

   See https://github.com/dxknight/helm-chronos

2.2 Quick start
===============

`M-x chronos-add-timer' will start chronos and prompt you to add a
timer.  When prompted for the time, enter an integer number of
minutes for the timer to count down from (see *note expiry time
specification: time-spec. for more sophisticated options).  When
prompted for the message, enter a short description of the timer for
display and notification.

   Alternatively, you can use `M-x chronos-add-timers-from-string'.
This function prompts for a string, from which one or more timers can
be parsed. See the section *note Add timers from string:
add-timers-from-string.

3 Configuration
***************

No configuration is required, but the defaults can be customized with
`M-x customize-group' `chronos' or set in your init file.

   You may wish to bind `chronos-add-timer', set the notification
function `chronos-action-function' and change the faces used in the
chronos buffer.

4 Controls
**********

New timers can be added from anywhere in Emacs by calling `M-x
chronos-add-timer'.  Further commands are available in the *chronos*
buffer.  *note Commands in the *chronos* buffer: buff-cmds.

4.1 Adding a timer
==================

When adding a timer, `chronos-add-timer' will prompt for an expiry
time and a message.

4.1.1 Expiry time specification
-------------------------------

The expiry time specification can be absolute or relative. Relative
times are with respect to a base time that, depending on
circumstances, could be:

   * current time, or

   * the expiry time of another timer

4.1.1.1 absolute time
.....................

Start with an `=', followed by a 24+hr clock time.  For example,
`=17:00' is an expiry time of five o'clock in the afternoon.  Times
are for the current day.  If you want to refer to times past midnight,
add 24 hours: e.g. `=25:30' specifies 1:30 tomorrow morning.

4.1.1.2 relative time
.....................

Up to three numbers can be given, separated with colons `:'.  A minus
`-' can be prepended to indicate negative times.

   * No numbers (or all zeros) - the base time

   * One number - minutes

   * two numbers - hours and minutes and

   * three numbers - hours minutes and seconds.

   Positive numbers indicate later expiry, negative ones earlier.

   For example, if the current time is 17:00:

   * `5' gives an expiry time of 17:05

   * `1:30' gives 18:30

   * `0:0:30' gives 30 seconds after 17:00

   * `0' gives a count up timer starting now, at 17:00.

   Negative relative times are more useful against existing timers.
Here, a timer was set for the absolute time 19:00, then with the
cursor on this timer and using `C-u a', two relative timers were set
to expire earlier, one with `-5' (five minutes before end, i.e.
18:55) and the other with `-15' (fifteen minutes before end, i.e.
18:45).

         Expiry      Elapsed      To go  Message
         [18:04]                         --now--
         [18:45]          45      41:10  Any questions
         [18:55]          58      51:10  Thanks and goodbyes
         [19:00]        2:01      56:10  Talk ends

4.1.2 Add timers from string
----------------------------

Although mainly useful for the helm-chronos helm interface, `M-x
chronos-add-timers-from-string' can be used to add multiple
consecutive timers from one string.  If the first timer in the string
has a relative expiry time, this is relative to current time or, with
the prefix argument, to the currently selected timer.  Subsequent
relative timers in the string are with respect to the expiry time of
the previous timer in the string.

   The format of the string for a single timer is `<expiry
specification>/<message>'.  Multiple cumulative timers can be
specified by separating them with `+'.

   For example: "5/Coffee" would be for a timer expiring in five
minutes with the message "Coffee".

   You could enter a pomodoro style timer with:

     25/Pomodoro: Work on helm-chronos + 5/Pomodoro: Rest

   Which will give a timer to go off in 25 minutes and another in 30
(=25+5) minutes:

     Expiry      Elapsed      To go  Message
     [13:10]                         --now--
     [13:35]                  25:00  Pomodoro: Work on helm-chronos
     [13:40]                  30:00  Pomodoro: Rest

   A more complex example might be:

     =17:00/Drink coffee + -5/Brew coffee + -5/Boil kettle + 25/Finish break

   Which will give a timer at 5 o'clock to drink coffee, a timer five
minutes before that (16:55) to start brewing the coffee, a reminder
five minutes before that (16:50) to put the kettle on and a reminder
25 minutes after that (17:15) to finish drinking coffee and get back
to work.

     Expiry      Elapsed      To go  Message
     [13:19]                         --now--
     [16:50]                3:30:46  Boil kettle
     [16:55]                3:35:46  Brew coffee
     [17:00]                3:40:46  Drink coffeea
     [17:15]                3:55:46  Finish break

4.2 Commands in the *chronos* buffer
====================================

In the *chronos* buffer, new timers can be added, selected, paused,
unpaused, lapped, adjusted or deleted.  Default keybindings in this
buffer are:

`a'
     add a timer

`A'
     add multiple consecutive timer(s) in one go

`n'
`C-n'
`<down>'
     Select next timer

`p'
`C-p'
`<up>'
     Select previous timer

`SPC'
     pause/unpause selected timer

`d'
     delete selected timer

`D'
     delete all expired timers

`e'
     edit selected timer

`l'
     lap selected timer

`F'
     freeze/unfreeze the display

`q'
     quit window


   Whether relative times are against current time or the expiry time
of the selected timer is controlled by the prefix.

   * Adding a timer with `a' is relative to current time; `C-u a'
     will calculate expiry times relative to the selected timer.

   * Editing (adjusting) the selected timer with `e' will calculate
     times relative to the currently set expiry time of that timer.
     `C-u e' will calculate relative times against the current time.

4.2.1 Add a timer
-----------------

Adding a timer with `a' in the *chronos* buffer is the same as adding
a timer with `M-x chronos-add-timer'.

   Adding with `A' is the same as `M-x
chronos-add-timers-from-string'.

4.2.2 Move selection
--------------------

A timer is selected when the cursor is on its line.  The cursor can be
moved down and up the timer list, wrapping as necessary, with
`n'/`C-n'/`<down>' and `p'/`C-p'/`<up>'.

   The -now- timer can be selected, but cannot be paused, lapped or
deleted.

4.2.3 Pause/Unpause
-------------------

`SPC' pauses a running timer and unpauses a paused one.  Pausing a
timer halts the time to/since expiry and pushes back the expected
expiry time.  The time elapsed since setting up the timer continues to
increase.  The timer is displayed in the `chronos-paused' face

4.2.4 Deleting timers
---------------------

The selected timer can be deleted with `d'.  Alternatively, all
expired timers can be deleted with `D'.  Once deleted, they're gone.

4.2.5 Editing timers
--------------------

When editing a timer, you will be prompted for an expiry time
specification *note expiry time specification: time-spec.  If the edit
is started with `e', the new expiry time will be calculated relative
to the timer's existing expiry time.  If the edit is called with a
prefix `C-u e', the new expiry time will be relative to the current
time.

   You will also be prompted for a message, using the existing
message as a starting point.

4.2.6 Lap timers
----------------

When a timer is lapped by pressing `l':
   * The timer is paused, <n> (where n is the lap number) is appended
     to the message, as is the time that had elapsed until the timer
     was lapped.

   * A new timer is run continuing on from the one just lapped.

   For example, a countup timer was set with Time:0 and Message:Lap
timer example.

   After running for six seconds, the timer was lapped with `l'.
Eight seconds later, the timer was lapped again, then after five
seconds and then four.  These lap times, together with lap numbers in
<> were appended to the messages.  There is no lap time for lap 5, as
that timer hasn't been lapped yet.

   The 'To go' column gives the total elapsed time, e.g. the first
four laps took 23 seconds.

   The Elapsed column gives how long since the lap started - e.g. lap
2 started 24 seconds ago.

     Expiry      Elapsed      To go  Message
     [11:50]           7         30+ Lap timer example <5>
     [11:50]          11         23+ Lap timer example <4>       4
     [11:50]          17         19+ Lap timer example <3>       5
     [11:50]          24         14+ Lap timer example <2>       8
     [11:51]          30          6+ Lap timer example <1>       6
     [11:51]                         --now--

4.2.7 Freezing the display
--------------------------

Freezing the display with `F' prevents any updates to the *chronos*
buffer or triggering of expiry actions, but does not stop the timers
running.  Unfreezing the display updates the *chronos* buffer to
current values and triggers all outstanding actions.

4.2.8 Quitting, Killing and restarting
--------------------------------------

Quitting with `q' buries the *chronos* buffer, but timers continue to
run.  Switch back to the *chronos* buffer when required.

   Killing the *chronos* buffer in the usual away (typically `C-x k')
checks for running timers and, on confirmation from the user, deletes
all timers and closes the buffer.  To restart after a kill, use `M-x
chronos-add-timer'.

5 Notifications
***************

By default, expired timers are shown above the -now- line, highlit
with the `chronos-expired' face, until they are deleted.  Additional
actions can be set for when a timer expires by adding functions to
the hook `chronos-expiry-functions'

   Countup timers (those started with 0 time to expire) do not
trigger these notifications, although they are highlit with the
`chronos-expired' face.

   If an unexpired timer is edited so that its expiry time is now in
the past, no notification will be triggered.  Conversely, adjusting
an expired timer so that its expiry time is now in the future will
trigger any notifications when the timer expires.

5.0.1 chronos-expiry-functions
------------------------------

The hook `chronos-expiry-functions' is empty by default so it can be
set directly in your init file as a list of functions.
Alternatively, you can use `add-hook' and `remove-hook', or the
customization system (`customize-group' `chronos-notifications'.

   This hook is "abnormal", in that all functions added must take an
argument: the expired timer.

   Standard functions available are:

`chronos-message-notify'
     Issues a message to the echo area and *Messages* buffer

`chronos-sound-notify'
     Plays `chronos-notification-wav' (if Emacs is compiled with sound
     support and the specified wav file exists).

`chronos-desktop-notifications-notify'
     Sends a desktop notification (if Emacs is compiled with libnotify
     support and running in a suitable dbus / consolekit /
     notification daemon environment).

`chronos-buffer-notify'
     Displays the timer's message in the *chronos* buffer, in
     the`chronos-notification' face for `chronos-notification-time'
     seconds.

`chronos-shell-notify'
     Runs `chronos-shell-notify-program' (if it exists) with
     parameters `chronos-shell-notify-parameters'.

`chronos-dunstify'
     Uses the `dunst' notification daemon (requires dunst and dbus
     but not consolekit).

`chronos-text-to-speech-notify'
     Uses `chronos-text-to-speech-program' (such as `espeak') with
     `chronos-text-to-speech-program-parameters' to speak the expiry
     time and message.


   For example, in my init file I have:

     (setq chronos-shell-notify-program "mpv"
           chronos-shell-notify-parameters '("--really-quiet"
                                             "--af=scaletempo=speed=pitch"
                                             "--speed=0.65"
                                             "~/wip/progs/cdt/temple-bell-zen.mp3")
           chronos-text-to-speech-program "espeak"
           chronos-text-to-speech-program-parameters "-s 100"
           chronos-expiry-functions '(chronos-dunstify
                                      chronos-buffer-notify
                                      chronos-shell-notify
                                      chronos-text-to-speech-notify))

   This sets the notification sequence to pop up a dunst
notification, put the message in the *chronos* buffer in big text,
run `mpv' in the shell with various parameters to give a slowed down
temple bell and then speak the time and message with `espeak'.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
     other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of
     freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
     redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
     commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License
     preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
     their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
     copyleft license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same
     freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not
     limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
     work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as
     a printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
     whose purpose is instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a
     notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
     duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
     The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any
     member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".
     You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the
     work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing
     the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
     Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
     relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the
     subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the
     Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
     none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text
     may be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
     copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
     to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings)
     some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for
     input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
     variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A
     copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup,
     or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
     subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image
     format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of
     text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats
     include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary
     formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
     processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing
     tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
     HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
     output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
     itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold,
     legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the
     title page.  For works in formats which do not have any title
     page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most
     prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
     beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes
     copies of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
     parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
     language.  (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name
     mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
     "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title" of such
     a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
     section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
     in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any
     other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is
     void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
     you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.
     You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
     reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
     However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If
     you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
     follow the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
     above, and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
     and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also
     clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
     copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
     words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
     other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
     limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
     Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
     verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
     or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location
     from which the general network-using public has access to
     download using public-standard network protocols a complete
     Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If
     you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent
     steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
     to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible
     at the stated location until at least one year after the last
     time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your
     agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
     of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that
     you release the Modified Version under precisely this License,
     with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version
     to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do
     these things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be
          listed in the History section of the Document).  You may
          use the same title as a previous version if the original
          publisher of that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
          you from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown
          in the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its
          Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title,
          year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as
          given on the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled
          "History" in the Document, create one stating the title,
          year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on
          its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
          Version as stated in the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
          Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the
          Document, and likewise the network locations given in the
          Document for previous versions it was based on.  These may
          be placed in the "History" section.  You may omit a network
          location for a work that was published at least four years
          before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of
          the version it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or
          "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and
          preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each
          of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
          given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section
          numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the
          section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do
     this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
     Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be
     distinct from any other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
     contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
     various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
     the text has been approved by an organization as the
     authoritative definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If
     the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
     entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but
     you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
     previous publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or
     to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
     single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the
     same name but different contents, make the title of each such
     section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
     name of the original author or publisher of that section if
     known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
     section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
     notice of the combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".
     You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the
     individual copies of this License in the various documents with
     a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that
     you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of
     each of the documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you
     insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
     follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
     copying of that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume
     of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if
     the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to
     limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what
     the individual works permit.  When the Document is included in
     an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in
     the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the
     Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,
     or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in
     electronic form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers
     that bracket the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
     section 4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations
     requires special permission from their copyright holders, but
     you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections
     in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
     Sections.  You may include a translation of this License, and
     all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty
     Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English
     version of this License and the original versions of those
     notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the
     translation and the original version of this License or a notice
     or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing
     the actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of
     the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time
     you have received notice of violation of this License (for any
     work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation
     prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
     of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
     See `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it,
     you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
     of that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by
     the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a
     proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be
     used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
     permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
     Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means
     any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and
     also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
     works.  A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of
     such a server.  A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC")
     contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus
     published on the MMC site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a
     not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in
     San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions
     of that license published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole
     or in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated
     prior to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in
     the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before
     August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
