;;; Commentary:

;; AUCTeX is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for
;; writing input files for TeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt, Texinfo, and docTeX
;; using Emacs.  One component of AUCTeX is preview-latex which provides
;; true "What You See Is What You Get" experience in the sourcebuffer.

;;; Code:

;; This can be used for starting up AUCTeX, e.g., when not installed
;; from ELPA.  We have to set `no-byte-compile' to t otherwise the
;; compiler will eval the form during the compilation where
;; `load-file-name' is nil and things will go wrong.

         (expand-file-name "tex-site.el"

  "AUCTeX version.")
