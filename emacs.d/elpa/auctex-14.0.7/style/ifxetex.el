;;; Commentary:

;; This file adds support for `ifxetex.sty' 0.7.  The package is now
;; part of 'iftex' bundle and therefore, the code is now in
;; 'iftex.el'.

;;; Code:

(require 'tex)

(TeX-add-style-hook
 "ifxetex"
 (lambda ()
   ;; Run the style hook for 'iftex' which does the work:
   (TeX-run-style-hooks "iftex"))
 TeX-dialect)

(defvar LaTeX-ifxetex-package-options nil
  "Package options for the ifxetex package.")

;;; ifxetex.el ends here
