;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Place this file somewhere in your Emacs Lisp path, i.e. `load-path',
;; and add this to your `.emacs' file:
;;
;;     (require 'tup-mode)
;;
;; Files ending with the `*.tup' extension, or files named `Tupfile'
;; or `tup.config' automatically enable tup-mode.
;;
;;
;;
;;; Code:
;;
;; The functions `tup/run-command-*' are the only functions that are
;; part of the public API.  No external code should ever rely on any
;; other functions or variables except for those.  Everything else is
;; private and may change at any time.
