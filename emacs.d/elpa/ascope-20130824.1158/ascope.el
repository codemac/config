;;; ascope.el --- Another cscope interface for emacs
;; Version: 20130824.1158

;;
;; comment:
;; Because xcscope.el open a new process of "cscope -L" for each a
;; definition, it's wasting time for reloading cscope and reopening
;; database.
;;Another cscope interface called bscope can get the search result quick but it is weak in the presentation of search result. 
;;This script merge the xcscope.el and bscope.el together make it fast and versatile

;; Usage:
;;load this script using (require 'ascope.el) in you .emacs
;; M-x ascope-init load the cscope database. This command must be issue prior to issue any other command below, the directory feed to this command must be the directory include the cscope.out file
;; M-x ascope-find-global-definition
;; M-x ascope-find-this-symbol
;; M-x ascope-find-this-text-string
;; M-x ascope-find-functions-calling-this-function
;; M-x ascope-find-called-functions
;; M-x ascope-find-files-including-file
;; M-x ascope-all-symbol-assignments
;; M-x ascope-clear-overlay-arrow
;; M-x ascope-pop-mark


;;run next commands in the search result buffer (*Result)
;;ascope-next-symbol this command is bind to key "n"
;;ascope-prev-symbol this command is bind to key "p"
;;ascope-select-entry-other-window-delete-window this command is bind to key "enter"

Using cscope, you can easily search for where symbols are used and defined.
It is designed to answer questions like:

Where is this variable used?
What is the value of this preprocessor symbol?
Where is this function in the source files?
What functions call this function?
What functions are called by this function?
Where does the message \"out of space\" come from?
Where is this source file in the directory structure?
What files include this header file?
