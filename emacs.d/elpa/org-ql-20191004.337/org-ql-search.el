  "Show a sparse tree for QUERY in BUFFER and return number of results.
The tree will show the lines where the query matches, and any
other context defined in `org-show-context-detail', which see.

QUERY is an `org-ql' query sexp (quoted, since this is a
function).  BUFFER defaults to the current buffer.

When KEEP-PREVIOUS is non-nil (interactively, with prefix), the
outline is not reset to the overview state before finding
matches, which allows stacking calls to this command.

Runs `org-occur-hook' after making the sparse tree."

Interactively, prompt for these variables:

BUFFERS-FILES: A list of buffers and/or files to search.
Interactively, may also be:

- `buffer': search the current buffer
- `all': search all Org buffers
- `agenda': search buffers returned by the function `org-agenda-files'
- An expression which evaluates to a list of files/buffers
- A space-separated list of file or buffer names

SUPER-GROUPS: An `org-super-agenda' group set.  See variable
`org-super-agenda-groups'.

NARROW: When non-nil, don't widen buffers before
searching. Interactively, with prefix, leave narrowed.

SORT: One or a list of `org-ql' sorting functions, like `date' or
`priority'.

TITLE: An optional string displayed in the header.

BUFFER: Optionally, a buffer or name of a buffer in which to
display the results.  By default, the value of
`org-ql-view-buffer' is used, and a new buffer is created if
necessary."
