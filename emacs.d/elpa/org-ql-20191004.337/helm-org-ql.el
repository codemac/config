;;; helm-org-ql.el --- Helm commands for org-ql  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; URL: https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql

;;; Commentary:

;; This library includes Helm commands for `org-ql'.  Note that Helm
;; is not declared as a package dependency, so this does not cause
;; Helm to be installed.  In the future, this file may have its own
;; package recipe, which would allow it to be installed separately and
;; declare a dependency on Helm.

(cl-defun helm-org-ql (buffers-files
                       &optional (no-and current-prefix-arg) (name "helm-org-ql"))
  "Display results in BUFFERS-FILES for an `org-ql' query using Helm.
Interactively, search the current buffer.

NOTE: Atoms in the query are turned into strings where
appropriate, which makes it unnecessary to type quotation marks
around words that are intended to be searched for as indepenent
strings.

Also, unless NO-AND is non-nil (interactively, with prefix), all
query tokens are wrapped in an implied (and) form.  This is
because a query must be a sexp, so when typing multiple clauses,
either (and) or (or) would be required around them, and (and) is
typically more useful, because it narrows down results.

For example, this raw input:

    Emacs git

Is transformed into this query:

    (and \"Emacs\" \"git\")

However, quoted strings remain quoted, so this input:

    \"something else\" (tags \"funny\")

Is transformed into this query:

    (and \"something else\" (tags \"funny\"))"
