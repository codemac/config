;; Keywords: hypermedia, outlines, Org, agenda

;;; Commentary:

;; `org-ql' is a lispy query language for Org files.  It allows you to
;; find Org entries matching certain criteria and return a list of
;; them or perform actions on them.  Commands are also provided which
;; display a buffer with matching results, similar to an Org Agenda
;; buffer.

  "Return items matching QUERY in BUFFERS-OR-FILES.

BUFFERS-OR-FILES is a file or buffer, a list of files and/or
buffers, or a function which returns such a list.

QUERY is an `org-ql' query sexp (quoted, since this is a
function).

ACTION is a function which is called on each matching entry with
point at the beginning of its heading.  It may be:

- `element' or nil: Equivalent to `org-element-headline-parser'.

- `element-with-markers': Equivalent to calling
  `org-element-headline-parser', with markers added using
  `org-ql--add-markers'.  Suitable for formatting with
  `org-ql-view--format-element', allowing insertion into an Org
  Agenda-like buffer.

- A sexp, which will be byte-compiled into a lambda function.

- A function symbol.

If NARROW is non-nil, buffers are not widened (the default is to
widen and search the entire buffer).

SORT is either nil, in which case items are not sorted; or one or
a list of defined `org-ql' sorting methods (`date', `deadline',
`scheduled', `todo', `priority', or `random'); or a user-defined
comparator function that accepts two items as arguments and
returns nil or non-nil."
