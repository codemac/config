YASnippet is a code template system for Emacs.  To enable it in all
buffers, add the following line to your init file:

   (yas-global-mode 1)

Alternatively, you can enable `yas-minor-mode' in individual buffers.
When YASnippet is active, the following commands can be used:

TAB (`yas-expand')
   Attempt to expand a snippet before point.  For example, typing TAB
   after `if' may expand a snippet beginning with `if', if one exists.
   If no snippet expansion is possible, run the usual binding of TAB.

`C-c & C-s' (`yas-insert-snippet')
   Prompts for a snippet, and inserts it.

`C-c & C-n' (`yas-new-snippet')
   Opens a *new snippet* buffer where you can define a new snippet.
   Typing C-c C-c in this buffer saves and invokes the definition.
   The variable `yas-snippet-dirs' determines where snippet
   definitions are stored.

`C-c & C-v' (`yas-visit-snippet-file')
   Prompt for, and visit an existing snippet definition.
