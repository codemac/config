This is /home/melpa/melpa/working/ess-20131101.1343/stabilty.info,
produced by makeinfo version 4.13 from
/home/melpa/melpa/working/ess/doc/stabilty.texi.

All recent released versions are meant to be release-quality versions.
While some new features are being introduced, we are cleaning up and
improving the interface.  We know that there are many remaining
opportunities for documentation improvements, but all contributors are
volunteers and time is precious. Patches or suggested fixes with bug
reports are much appreciated!
