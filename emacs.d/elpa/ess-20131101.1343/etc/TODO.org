If you have focus-follows-mouse and mouse-autoselect-window set to t,
then ask for help in an *R* buffer, i.e.
> ?setwd

The help buffer steals focus permanently instead of surrendering it
to mouse movement; you need to physically click in the *R*
buffer to restore the focus following the mouse.  C-c C-d C-d
behaves similarly.  Ideally, we should respect the user's settings 
of focus-follows-mouse/mouse-autoselect-window in this common 
help/*R* buffer arrangement.

** TODO eldoc should ignore some functions
Some functions have no useful argument information to report and they
should simply be ignored.  Ideally, this feature would be customizable
so that each user could add their unfavorite functions.  To start, I
would put suggest: (), c(), list(), sqrt(), t()
