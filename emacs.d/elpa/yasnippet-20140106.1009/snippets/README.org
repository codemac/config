My snippets

In this repository there is a colletion of my personal [[http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/][yasnippet]]
snippets for many different Emacs modes.

To try them out:
1. install yasnippet
3. add to your .emacs the following
   - (add-to-list 'yas/root-directory "$DIRECTORY_WHERE_YOU_CLONED")
   - (yas/initialize)
4. M-x yas/reload-all to activate them
