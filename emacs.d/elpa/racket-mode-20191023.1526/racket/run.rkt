;; Main moving parts:
;;
;; 1. This main thread, which receives a couple messages on a channel
;;    (see channel.rkt). One message is a `rerun` struct with info
;;    about a new file/module to run. The main thread loops forever
;;    (the `run` function tail calls itself forever). The special case
;;    of racket/gui/base is handled with a custom module names
;;    resolver and another message.
;;
;; 2. A thread created for each run; loads a module and goes into
;;    a read-eval-print-loop.
;;
;; 3. A thread for a command server that listens on a TCP port (see
;;    command-server.rkt). One of the commands is a `run` command.
