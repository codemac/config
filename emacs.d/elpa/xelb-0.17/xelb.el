;;; Commentary:

;; Overview
;; --------
;; XELB (X protocol Emacs Lisp Binding) is a pure Elisp implementation of X11
;; protocol based on the XML description files from XCB project.  It features
;; an object-oriented API and permits a certain degree of concurrency.  It
;; should enable you to implement some low-level X11 applications.

;; How it works
;; ------------
;; As is well known, X11 is a network-transparent protocol.  All its messages,
;; including requests, replies, events, errors, etc are transported over
;; network.  Considering that Emacs is powerful enough to do network
;; communication, it is also possible to use Emacs to send / receive those X11
;; messages.  Here we fully exploit the asynchronous feature of network
;; connections in Emacs, making XELB concurrent in a sense.

;; X11 protocol is somewhat complicated, especially when extension protocols
;; are also concerned.  Fortunately, XCB project has managed to describe these
;; protocols as XML files, which are language-neutral and can be used to
;; generate language-specific bindings.  In XELB, X messages are represented as
;; 'classes', and their 'methodes' are provided to translate them to / from raw
;; byte arrays conveniently.

;; Usage
;; -----
;; Interfaces are mainly defined in 'xcb.el'.  Please refer to that file on how
;; to use them.  Most of other files are either X11 core / extension protocol
;; libraries (e.g. xcb-randr.el) or utility libraries (e.g. xcb-keysyms.el).
;; Please check the corresponding files for more details.

;;; Code:

(require 'xcb)

;; DO NOT load this library; load 'xcb.el' instead.
;; This dummy file is created as a placeholder as it is required by GNU ELPA.
