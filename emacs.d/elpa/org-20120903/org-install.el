Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.

With optional prefix argument TODO-ONLY, only consider entries that are
TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
EDIT-AT.

The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as
is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match
in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable
`org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean'.
Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to
Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  \"+\" or \"-\".

The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in
the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,
including newlines.

If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and
each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.
Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without
a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is
case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must
match whole words, not parts of a word) if
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words' is set (default is nil).

Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as
regular expressions that must or (when preceded with \"-\") must not
match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken
as a whole, to include whitespace.

- If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
- If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
  exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect
  that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.
- If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts
  with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the
  Boolean search must match as full words.

FUNC is a function or a lisp form.  The function will be called without
arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the headline.
The return values of all calls to the function will be collected and
returned as a list.

The call to FUNC will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so FUNC
does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the cursor will be
moved to the end of the line (presumably of the headline of the
processed entry) and search continues from there.  Under some
circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.  For example,
if you have removed (e.g. archived) the current (sub)tree it could
mean that the next entry will be skipped entirely.  In such cases, you
can specify the position from where search should continue by making
FUNC set the variable `org-map-continue-from' to the desired buffer
position.

MATCH is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda tags view.
Only headlines that are matched by this query will be considered during
the iteration.  When MATCH is nil or t, all headlines will be
visited by the iteration.

SCOPE determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:

nil     The current buffer, respecting the restriction if any
tree    The subtree started with the entry at point
region  The entries within the active region, if any
region-start-level
        The entries within the active region, but only those at
        the same level than the first one.
file    The current buffer, without restriction
file-with-archives
        The current buffer, and any archives associated with it
agenda  All agenda files
agenda-with-archives
        All agenda files with any archive files associated with them
\(file1 file2 ...)
        If this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned

The remaining args are treated as settings for the skipping facilities of
the scanner.  The following items can be given here:

  archive    skip trees with the archive tag.
  comment    skip trees with the COMMENT keyword
  function or Emacs Lisp form:
             will be used as value for `org-agenda-skip-function', so whenever
             the function returns t, FUNC will not be called for that
             entry and search will continue from the point where the
             function leaves it.

If your function needs to retrieve the tags including inherited tags
at the *current* entry, you can use the value of the variable
`org-scanner-tags' which will be much faster than getting the value
with `org-get-tags-at'.  If your function gets properties with
`org-entry-properties' at the *current* entry, bind `org-trust-scanner-tags'
to t around the call to `org-entry-properties' to get the same speedup.
Note that if your function moves around to retrieve tags and properties at
a *different* entry, you cannot use these techniques.
