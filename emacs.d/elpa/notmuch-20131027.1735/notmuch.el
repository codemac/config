  "Major mode displaying results of a notmuch search.

This buffer contains the results of a \"notmuch search\" of your
email archives. Each line in the buffer represents a single
thread giving a summary of the thread (a relative date, the
number of matched messages and total messages in the thread,
participants in the thread, a representative subject line, and
any tags).

Pressing \\[notmuch-search-show-thread] on any line displays that
thread. The '\\[notmuch-search-add-tag]' and
'\\[notmuch-search-remove-tag]' keys can be used to add or remove
tags from a thread. The '\\[notmuch-search-archive-thread]' key
is a convenience for archiving a thread (applying changes in
`notmuch-archive-tags'). The '\\[notmuch-search-tag-all]' key can
be used to add and/or remove tags from all messages (as opposed
to threads) that match the current query.  Use with caution, as
this will also tag matching messages that arrived *after*
constructing the buffer.

Other useful commands are '\\[notmuch-search-filter]' for
filtering the current search based on an additional query string,
'\\[notmuch-search-filter-by-tag]' for filtering to include only
messages with a given tag, and '\\[notmuch-search]' to execute a
new, global search.
