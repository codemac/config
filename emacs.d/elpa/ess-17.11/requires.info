This is requires.info, produced by makeinfo version 5.2 from
requires.texi.

ESS is most likely to work with current/recent versions of the following
statistical packages: R/S-PLUS, SAS, Stata, OpenBUGS and JAGS.

   ESS supports current, and recent, stable versions of GNU Emacs
(currently, 24.4 or higher; alpha/beta/pre-release versions are NOT
SUPPORTED).

   Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS requires, ESS support of
XEmacs ended with ESS 12.04-4.

   To build the PDF documentation, you will need a version of TeX Live
or texinfo that includes texi2dvi (BEWARE: recent TeX Live, and some
texinfo RPMs, do NOT include texi2dvi).
