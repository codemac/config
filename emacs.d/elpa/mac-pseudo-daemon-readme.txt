On Mac OS, if you use Cocoa Emacs' daemon mode and then close all
GUI frames, the Emacs app on your dock becomes nonfunctional until
you open a new GUI frame using emacsclient on the command line.
This is obviously suboptimal. This package makes it so that
whenever you close the last GUI frame, a new frame is created and
the Emacs app is hidden, thus approximating the behvaior of daemon
mode while keeping the Emacs dock icon functional. To actually quit
instead of hiding Emacs, use CMD+Q (or Alt+Q if you swapped Alt &
Command keys).
