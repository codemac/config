;;; Commentary:

;; Do grep in anything buffer. When we search information with grep,
;; we often narrow the candidates. Let's use `anything' to do it.

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `anything-grep'
;;    Run grep in `anything' buffer to narrow results.
;;  `anything-grep-by-name'
;;    Do `anything-grep' from predefined location.
;;  `anything-grep-by-name-reversed'
;;    Do `anything-grep' from predefined location.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;

;; `anything-grep' is simple interface to grep a query. It asks
;; directory to grep. The grep process is synchronous process. You may
;; have to wait when you grep the target for the first time. But once
;; the target is on the disk cache, queries are grepped at lightning
;; speed. Even if older Pentium4 computer, grepping from 180MB takes
;; only 0.2s! GNU grep is amazingly fast.

;; `anything-grep-by-name' asks query and predefined location. It is
;; good idea to have ack (ack-grep), grep implemented in Perl, to
;; exclude unneeded files. Such as RCS, .svn and so on.

;; ack -- better than grep, a power search tool for programmers
