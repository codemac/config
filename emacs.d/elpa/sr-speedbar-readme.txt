The sr-speedbar.el was created just because I could not believe what I
read on http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Speedbar.  They wrote there
that it is not possible to show the speedbar in the same frame.  But, as
we all know, ecb had this already.  So I started as some kind of joke :)
But when I found it useful and use it all the time.

Now you type windows key with 's' (`s-s' in Emacs) will show the speedbar
in an extra window, same frame.  You can customize the initial width of the
speedbar window.

Below are commands you can use:

`sr-speedbar-open'                   Open `sr-speedbar' window.
`sr-speedbar-close'                  Close `sr-speedbar' window.
`sr-speedbar-toggle'                 Toggle `sr-speedbar' window.
`sr-speedbar-select-window'          Select `sr-speedbar' window.
`sr-speedbar-refresh-turn-on'        Turn on refresh speedbar content.
`sr-speedbar-refresh-turn-off'       Turn off refresh speedbar content.
`sr-speedbar-refresh-toggle'         Toggle refresh speedbar content.

Enjoy! ;)
