* [Unreleased]

** Added

- Complete support for in-buffer completion of color support macros.
- Add new support files =style/contract.el=, =style/diagbox.el= and
  =style/standalone.el=.

** Fixed

- Add appropriate ~delete-selection~ properties for
  ~LaTeX-insert-left-brace~, ~TeX-insert-dollar~ and
  ~TeX-insert-backslash~ that differentiate between the "electric" and
  "just-insert-the-symbol" behavior.  That should simplify cooperation
  with other electric modes.

  As a result of this adjustment, the behavior of ~TeX-insert-dollar~
  is affected in some ways:
  - With raw prefix argument =C-u=, =$= (~TeX-insert-dollar~) now
    inserts four dollars as opposed to one.  This behavior is in-line
    with other symbols, in particular ="= (~TeX-insert-quote~) and =\=
    (~TeX-insert-backslash~).  If you need one literal =$=, you can type
    =C-1 $= or =C-q $=.
  - We no longer have explicit support of the special behavior that if
    ~TeX-electric-math~ is non-nil and point is inside math mode right
    between a couple of single dollars, pressing =$= will insert another
    pair of dollar signs and leave the point between them.

    It still works as before if ~TeX-electric-math~ is pair of dollars
    while it inserts =\(= and =\)= when ~TeX-electric-math~ is
    =("\(" . "\)")=.
  - When ~TeX-electric-math~ is a pair of dollars and the point is in
    inline math (without active region), =$= inserts two dollars, not
    one dollar which just closes the math mode.
- Recognize =.ltx= extension as regular LaTeX file.

** Removed

- Delete function ~LaTeX-env-contents~.
- Delete obsolete variables ~TeX-symbol-marker~,
  ~TeX-symbol-marker-pos~, ~TeX-dollar-sign~, ~TeX-dollar-string~ and
  ~TeX-dollar-regexp~.
- Delete obsolete minor-mode ~TeX-Omega-mode~.

* [14.0.5] - 2024-05-19

** Added

- Add support for indirect buffers cloned from buffers visiting a file.
  In indirect buffer, preview-latex works correctly when the command
  ~preview-region~ is invoked.  The command ~preview-document~ puts
  preview images in the base buffer, not in the indirect buffer itself.
- Add preliminary support for processing files with latexmk.  Support
  for =dvipdfmx= and the choice for viewer after compilation are not
  optimal, yet.  Overall, the support comes close to what the
  =auctex-latexmk= library provides.
- Add new command ~TeX-fold-section~ (bound to =C-c C-o C-s=) which
  hides all configured macros in the section containing point when
  ~TeX-fold-mode~ is active.  The unfold counterpart
  ~TeX-fold-clearout-section~ is bound to =C-c C-o s=.
- Add new custom option ~TeX-fold-region-functions~ which is a list of
  additional functions to call when folding a region.
- Add new custom option ~TeX-fold-auto-reveal~ which controls how the
  original source text is revealed when user clicks the folded portion
  by mouse.
- Add new custom options ~TeX-fold-auto-reveal-commands~ and
  ~preview-auto-reveal-commands~ which are lists of commands revealing
  folded or previewed buffer text.
- Add new custom option ~preview-protect-point~ which determines whether
  previews generated on top of the current point should be temporarily
  opened (~nil~ by default).
- Add new custom option ~preview-leave-open-previews-visible~ which
  determines if the preview code stays visible once opened.
- Change the default value of ~TeX-one-master~ in order to recognize the
  suffix =.ltx= as regular TeX files.
- Add new custom option ~ConTeXt-paragraph-commands~ containing a list
  of macros which should begin their own line.
- Support query and insert of ~mcite~ compatibility macro
  (=style/biblatex.el=).
- Support the =\verbatiminput*= macro (=style/verbatim.el=).
- Add new support file =style/amsrefs.el=.

** Fixed

- Adjust options when processing files with ConTeXt: Remove obsolete
  =--texutil=, use =--synctex=repeat= and omit =--nonstop= when
  ~TeX-source-correlate-mode~ is enabled.

* [14.0.4] - 2024-03-31

** Added

- Support completion for many commands described in =clsguide.tex=,
  =fntguide.tex= and =usrguide.tex=.
- Provide new custom option ~LaTeX-flymake-chktex-options~ to enable or
  disable specific warnings of =chktex= backend used by Flymake.
- Provide new custom option ~TeX-kill-process-without-query~ which
  controls if user is asked before aborting a running process for a TeX
  document.

** Fixed

- Improve guessing names for headers used in Imenu.

** Removed

- Revert usage of ~:local~ tag inside ~defcustom~.  This tag isn't
  handled correctly in Emacs 27.1 and breaks AUCTeX.

* [14.0.3] - 2024-02-20

** Fixed

- Cater for former mode name in customized ~TeX-command-list~.
- Fix and enhance pseudo-parent mode facility.

* [14.0.2] - 2024-02-09

** Fixed

- Fix ELPA releases.

* [14.0.1] - 2024-02-08

** Added

- AUCTeX changes major mode names.  Its primary purpose is to avoid
  conflicts with Emacs built-in TeX major modes.  It also improves
  consistency of the source code.
  - The overview of the former names and new names are:
    | Former name               | New name                  |
    |---------------------------+---------------------------|
    | ~plain-tex-mode~          | ~plain-TeX-mode~          |
    | ~latex-mode~              | ~LaTeX-mode~              |
    | ~doctex-mode~             | ~docTeX-mode~             |
    | ~texinfo-mode~            | ~Texinfo-mode~            |
    | ~ams-tex-mode~            | ~AmSTeX-mode~             |
    | ~japanese-plain-tex-mode~ | ~japanese-plain-TeX-mode~ |
    | ~japanese-latex-mode~     | ~japanese-LaTeX-mode~     |

    The undocumented modes ~context-en-mode~ and ~context-nl-mode~ were
    deleted.
  - We paid much attention to the compatibility and expect that almost
    no particular treatment on the user side is needed.  For example,
    the names of the keymaps and mode hooks remain unchanged, and the
    =mode:= tag in the file local variables in the existing files works
    with old mode names.  See below for more details
  - If your Emacs is 29 or newer and you use =desktop.el= to save and
    restore Emacs sessions, be careful before you update AUCTeX; You
    should attempt to update only after
    1. you kill all buffer under former AUCTeX modes which have
       overlapped name with Emacs built-in TeX modes, and
    2. you terminate the current Emacs session.
    The modes with such overlapped name are ~plain-tex-mode~,
    ~latex-mode~, ~doctex-mode~ and ~texinfo-mode~.  (The above
    prescription ensures no buffer of such modes is recorded in the
    desktop file.  Otherwise those buffers would be restored in the
    built-in modes, not AUCTeX modes, after the update of AUCTeX.)
  - New mode names are chosen to match the existing variables, so most
    user customizations as well as the third party libraries would
    continue to work without modification.  For example, names of
    keymaps and hooks don't change as stated above.
    (~AmS-TeX-mode-hook~ is renamed to ~AmSTeX-mode-hook~, but
    compatibility alias is provided.)
  - Now ~TeX-add-local-master~ adds entry of new mode names such as
    #+begin_example
      %%% Local Variables:
      %%% mode: LaTeX      <-- not `latex'
      %%% End:
    #+end_example
  - The compatibility with the former mode names with respect to
    invoking the major mode are retained.
    1. Former modes which overlap with built-in modes, namely
       ~plain-tex-mode~, ~latex-mode~, ~doctex-mode~, ~texinfo-mode~ and
       ~tex-mode~ are handled by redirections; the same override advices
       as before are continued to used for Emacs<29 while
       ~major-mode-remap-alist~ is used for Emacs 29 and later.
       (Therefore, if there are user codes which call ~latex-mode~
       directly, built-in ~latex-mode~ runs instead of AUCTeX
       ~LaTeX-mode~ in Emacs 29 and later.)

       These redirections still honor your customization to ~TeX-modes~
       option.  Thus you are served by built-in ~plain-tex-mode~ and
       AUCTeX ~LaTeX-mode~ if you exclude ~plain-tex-mode~ from
       ~TeX-modes~.
    2. Other former names, e.g. ~context-mode~ and
       ~japanese-latex-mode~, are handled by aliases such as
       #+begin_src emacs-lisp
         (defalias 'context-mode #'ConTeXt-mode)
       #+end_src
  - New modes recognize directory local variables prepaired for the
    former mode name.  For example, directory local variables for
    ~latex-mode~ are valid in ~LaTeX-mode~ as well.  So you don't have
    to rewrite every former mode name to the new one in
    =.dir-locals.el=.
  - Your abbrevs are preserved.  For example, ~latex-mode-abbrev-table~,
    if exists, is automatically included as a parent of
    ~LaTeX-mode-abbrev-table~.
  - Now all major modes are defined by ~define-derived-mode~, so
    standard inheritance of keymaps, syntax tables etc. takes place.
    The inheritance relations are:
    #+begin_example
      text-mode      --+-- TeX-mode
                       +-- Texinfo-mode

      TeX-mode       --+-- plain-TeX-mode
                       +-- LaTeX-mode
                       +-- ConTeXt-mode

      plain-TeX-mode --+-- AmSTeX-mode
                       +-- japanese-plain-TeX-mode

      LaTeX-mode     --+-- docTeX-mode
                       +-- japanese-LaTeX-mode
    #+end_example

    These inheritance relations are taken into account for directory
    local variables in the standard way.  For example, directory local
    variables for ~LaTeX-mode~ are applied to ~docTeX-mode~ now.

    Note that ~TeX-mode~ isn't meant for use for end users.  It is only
    meant for the base mode for other major modes.  Its role is to
    provide base keymap, hook and syntax table under the same name with
    the former AUCTeX and run the common initialization code.

    Now that all modes have ~text-mode~ as their ancestor, they inherit
    its keymap and syntax table.  In addition, dir local vars for
    ~text-mode~ are applied to all AUCTeX major mode.

    However, ~Texinfo-mode~ is exceptional in the following two aspects:
    1. It doesn't inherit ~text-mode-syntax-table~ because it simply
       uses built-in mode's ~texinfo-mode-syntax-table~, which is
       independent of ~text-mode-syntax-table~.  This situation is the
       same with the former AUCTeX Texinfo mode.
    2. ~Texinfo-mode-map~ has ~TeX-mode-map~ as its direct parent.  This
       is the same with the former AUCTeX Texinfo mode.  Now it inherits
       ~text-mode-map~ indirectly through ~TeX-mode-map~.

  - There are new keymaps, hooks and abbrev tables:
    ~Texinfo-mode-abbrev-table~, ~japanese-plain-TeX-mode-map~,
    ~japanese-LaTeX-mode-map~, ~japanese-plain-TeX-mode-hook~,
    ~japanese-LaTeX-mode-hook~, ~japanese-plain-TeX-mode-abbrev-table~,
    ~japanese-LaTeX-mode-abbrev-table~.

- AUCTeX now requires GNU Emacs 27.1 or higher.
