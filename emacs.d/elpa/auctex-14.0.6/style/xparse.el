;;; Commentary:

;; The content of this file is now (December 2023) part of latex.el
;; and font-latex.el.  This style provides only completion for xparse
;; package options and some macros re-allocated from the kernel back
;; into xparse.sty with LaTeX release 2023-11-01.

;; The "yet not more supported" specifiers `l', `u', `g' and `G' are
;; ignored completely and may lead to wrong parsing results.

;;; Code:

(require 'tex)
(require 'latex)

(TeX-add-style-hook
 "xparse"
 (lambda ()
   (TeX-add-symbols
    ;; Access to the argument specification
    '("GetDocumentCommandArgSpec" TeX-arg-macro)
    '("GetDocumentEnvironmmentArgSpec" TeX-arg-environment)
    '("ShowDocumentCommandArgSpec" TeX-arg-macro)
    '("ShowDocumentEnvironmentArgSpec" TeX-arg-environment)))
 TeX-dialect)

(defvar LaTeX-xparse-package-options-list
  '(("log-declarations" ("true" "false")))
  "Package options for the xparse package.")

(defun LaTeX-xparse-package-options ()
  "Read the xparse package options from the user."
  (TeX-read-key-val t LaTeX-xparse-package-options-list))
