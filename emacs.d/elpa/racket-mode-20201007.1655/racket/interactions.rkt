;; an exit and letting the exit-handler in run.rkt cleanup the TCP
;; connection. This handles the case where e.g. the user kills the
;; REPL buffer and its process on the client/Emacs side. We used to
;; have code here in an effort support lang/datalog using eof as an
;; expression separator -- but that just causes an endless loop 100%
;; CPU spike with an abandoned tcp-input-port. So give up on that,
;; reverting issue #305.
