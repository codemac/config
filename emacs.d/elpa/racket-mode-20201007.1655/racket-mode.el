(defun racket-mode-start-faster ()
  "Compile Racket Mode's .rkt files for faster startup.

Racket Mode is implemented as an Emacs Lisp \"front end\" that
talks to a Racket process \"back end\". Because Racket Mode is
delivered as an Emacs package instead of a Racket package,
installing it does not do the `raco setup` that is normally done
for Racket packages.

This command will do a `raco make` of Racket Mode's .rkt files,
creating bytecode files in `compiled/` subdirectories. As a
result, when a `racket-run' or `racket-repl' command must start
the Racket process, it will start faster.

If you run this command, ever, you should run it again after:

- Installing an updated version of Racket Mode. Otherwise, you
  might lose some of the speed-up.

- Installing a new version of Racket and/or changing the value of
  the variable `racket-program'. Otherwise, you might get an
  error message due to the bytecode being different versions."

This command is useful in several situations:

- You are not using `racket-xp-mode' for a `racket-mode' edit
  buffer, so `racket-xp-documentation' is not available.

- There is no `racket-repl-mode' buffer with a live namespace, so
  `racket-repl-documentation' is not available or helpful.

- You want to search for definitions provided by all modules --
  for example, the \"define\" syntax provided by racket/base, by
  typed/racket/base, and by other modules, as well definitions or
  topics that merely include \"define\".

This command does not try to go directly to the help topic for a
definition provided by any specific module. Instead it goes to
the Racket \"Search Manuals\" page."
