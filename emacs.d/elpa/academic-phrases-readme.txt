When writing your academic paper, you might get stuck trying to find the
right phrase that captures your intention. This package tries to alleviate
that problem by presenting you with a list of phrases organized by the topic
or by the paper section that you are writing. This package has around 600
phrases so far.

Using this package is easy, just call `M-x academic-phrases` to
get a list of phrases organized by topic, or call
`academic-phrases-by-section` to browse the phrases by the paper
section and fill-in the blanks if required.
