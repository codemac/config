This is onews.info, produced by makeinfo version 5.2 from onews.texi.

Changes/New Features in 5.14:
   * ESS[BUGS/JAGS]: Batch BUGS is back!  For recent OpenBUGS versions,
     3.0.8+, a batch BUGS script is once again available, but for Linux
     only.  Therefore, since it seems that BUGS and JAGS must co-exist
     (rather than a transition from BUGS to JAGS), .bug files are now in
     ESS[BUGS] mode and .jag files are in ESS[JAGS] mode.  ESS[BUGS] now
     works like ESS[JAGS] rather than the original mode ESS[BUGS] mode
     which was difficult to maintain.  Although, ESS[BUGS] appears to
     work, there still may be some features missing as well as bugs.

   * ESS[R]: New customizable variable 'ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p'
     Commands to Sweave current file and LaTeX the result are now
     available to AUCTeX users, if this variable is set to 't'.

   * ESS[S]: 'C-c C-c' ('ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step') is
     now skipping over comments as the other paragraph functions do.  It
     (and similar functions) should no longer wrongly find 'function()'
     beginnings inside comments or strings.

   * ESS[SAS]: improved by better support for GNU Emacs

   Changes/New Features in 5.13:
   * ESS[R]: On Windows, for R 2.12.0 and later, the Rterm executables
     (in subdirectories i386 / x64) now are found as well as for earlier
     R versions.
   * ESS[S+]: on Windows, both 32- and 64-bit versions of S+ ("S-PLUS")
     are found now and made available on the menu.
   * ESS[R]: When prompting for a starting directory, the R version is
     (always?)  correct now.
   * ESS[R]: on non-Windows platforms, the 'use-dialog-box' variable is
     no longer temporarily changed (to 'nil' for R-x.y.z version
     functions and to 't' for 'R' itself), but rather the user
     customization is obeyed.
   * ESS[R]: more Roxygen improvements.
   * 'Rd-preview-help' now generates preview buffers with navigation
     facilities the same as regular help buffers.
   * ESS: New functions and keys C-c [up] / [down] for evaluating the
     buffer "from beginning till here".

   Changes/New Features in 5.12:
   * ESS[SAS] Font-locking: update of PROCs keywords (up to SAS 9.22);
     error/warnings.
   * ESS[R]: Roxygen improvements: S4 classes; also optionally keep
     spaces when filling arguments
   * ESS[Rd]: support new keywords: section-name \subsection plus a
     dozen "new" keywords; should match R 2.12.x now.
   * 'ess-display-help-on-object' ('C-c C-v') now _caches_ the list of
     topics, thus speeding up the improvement feature introduced in 5.9.

   Changes/New Features in 5.11:
   * Filename completion within buffers now adds only trailing
     characters to complete the filename, rather than expanding to an
     absolute file path.  This filename completion is bound to the TAB
     key.

   * 'M-n P' in Sweave buffers now prompts for the command to run
     instead of using 'pdflatex' unconditionally, offering completion
     from customizable collection 'ess-swv-pdflatex-commands', the first
     of which is taken as default and that defaults to 'texi2pdf'.
   * 'M-RET' is now also bound in S language (R and S+) buffers to
     'ess-use-this-dir'.  It sends 'setwd(..)' to the S process to set
     the working directory to the one of the source file.

   Changes/New Features in 5.10:
   * 'M-RET' in *S* buffers is now bound to 'ess-dirs'.  This function
     will set Emacs's current directory to be the same as the *S*
     process.  This is useful if you use 'setwd()' within a *S* process.

   Changes/New Features in 5.9:
   * Toolbar: The toolbar now has an icon for starting Splus.
   * Indentation: New documentation and code has been added to make it
     easier to change how ESS indents code.  In particular, see
     'ess-default-style', 'ess-own-style-list' and the documention
     subsection "Changing indentation styles".
   * 'ess-display-help-on-object' ('C-c C-v') now offers completion
     candidates for help file aliases, in addition to object names.
   * Font locking: is now turned on even without 'window-system' is
     'nil', whenever ESS-FONT-LOCK-MODE is non-nil, i.e., by default.
   * ESS script editing: ess-eval-deactivate-mark default is now t, as
     suggested by Leo Alekseyev and subsequent "unanimous" ESS-help
     discussion.
   * ESS[R]: Editing support for "#!"  (Rscript / littler) editing,
     thanks to Jeffrey Arnold.
   * ESS[R]: Now finds all R versions, both 64-bit and 32-bit, on some
     64-bit Windows machines.  Please report back to ess-core success or
     failure on your 64-bit Windows machine.
   * ESS Manual now more visually pleasing;
     <http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html>
   * ESS[R]: Roxygen on XEmacs no longer font locks for now (as it
     required missing features and hence broke ESS startup, there).
   * ESS[R]: Roxygen has a sub-menu on the [ESS] menu.
   * ESS[R]: Function 'ess-rutils-htmldocs' in 'ess-rutils.el' offers an
     alternative to 'help.start()' for navigating R documentation, using
     the 'browse-url' Emacs function.

   Changes/New Features in 5.8:
   * ESS[R]: New 'ess-rutils.el' with utilities for listing, loading,
     installing, and updating packages, as well as object manipulation
     (listing, viewing, and deleting).  It also provides an alternative
     to 'RSiteSearch()' that uses the 'browse-url' function, so results
     can be viewed in an Emacs web browser.
   * ESS[R]: much more extensive Roxygen interface, via ess-roxy.el from
     Henning Redestig.  Ess-roxy supports filling of roxygen fields,
     generation and updating roxygen templates, completion of roxygen
     tags, basic navigation (marking and moving between entries),
     folding using hs-minor-mode and preview of the Rd file.
   * Emacs lisp files have got better names (partly, for now).

   Changes/New Features in 5.7:
   * ESS[R]: loading a source file ('C-c C-l') now works in Windows,
     similarly to other platforms; (further; it had accidentally been
     broken in ESS 5.6 on all platforms)

   Changes/New Features in 5.6:
   * ESS[R]: help() calls have to differ from old default, with newer
     versions of R; currently via .help.ESS <- function(...)  hack.

   Changes/New Features in 5.4:
   * ESS[SAS]: The long overdue change from 'make-regexp' to
     'regexp-opt' for font-locking is complete.  The new 'regexp-opt' is
     now the default since it is better than the old code in many ways
     (and especially more maintainable).  However, there are certainly
     some special cases missed (bug reports and patches welcome!).
     Setting 'ess-sas-run-regexp-opt' to 'nil' will result in the old
     code being used.
   * ESS[BUGS] and ESS[JAGS]: typing '=' now results in '<-'.
   * ESS[R] function arguments "show" '(ess-r-args-show)' now uses the
     new '(tooltip-show-at-point)' contributed by Erik Iverson.
   * Toolbar icons now also work in (beta) Emacs 23.
   * ESS[S]: New function 'ess-change-directory' for setting both emacs'
     current directory and the directory of an *R* or *S* buffer.
   * ESS[S] when transient-mark-mode is true, the mark is now kept,
     rather than deactivated, thanks to a patch from David Reitter.

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.11:
   * ESS[SAS]: work around bug in Emacs 22.2 & 22.3 which fails to set
     case-fold fontification automatically.
   * Rd mode: support new keyword 'Rdversion'
   * ESS[R]: now again works with Emacs 21.x

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.10:
   * Fixed noweb-mode bug accidentally introduced into 5.3.9
   * In noweb-mode, e.g., Rnw-mode, electric "<" also inserts closing
     "@".  Further, the code chunk boundaries are better kept
     up-to-date, such that code[R] <-> text[LaTeX] minor mode switching
     should happen more reliably.
   * In noweb-mode, fix a buglet in rare [Enter] or [Tab] behavior;
     further, by default disable the former '[[' ..  ']]'
     code-protection-when-filling behavior which has been found to be
     buggy.

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.9:
   * ESS[SAS]: evince PDF viewer now supported as well; search order:
     evince, Xpdf, Adobe/Acrobat Reader
   * ESS[R]: added support for Roxygen, potentially to be extended.
   * ESS[S] (and R): inferior ('*R*') and transcript modes no longer
     fontify language keywords (such as 'for', 'in', etc).
   * iESS[Stata]: Customize the 'ess-sta-delimiter-friendly' setting to
     't' to convert embedded semi-colons to newlines for Stata
     processing.
   * Sweave fix for embedded blanks in PDF reader and PDF files
   * Several fixes for Major Mode Convention violations in 'ess-mode'
     and 'noweb-mode'.
   * ESS[JAGS]: 'M-x comment-region' now available!
   * ESS[S] The 'ess-swv-*' commands (and keybindings) are now in a
     submenu of the "Noweb" menu, when editing Sweave files.

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.8:
   * ESS[JAGS]: more separation from ESS[BUGS] (as much as is currently
     planned); now 'C-c C-c' on an empty '.jmd' creates a template as it
     should; symbolic links are created for CODA output so BOA is happy:
     from 'index.txt' to '.ind' and 'chain#.txt' to '#.out'
   * ESS[SAS]: buffer-local 'ess-sas-submit-command' and
     'ess-sas-submit-command-options' now recognized by
     'ess-sas-submit-region'
   * ESS[S]: When trying to evaluate code in an S language buffer and
     there is no associated process, now start R automatically instead
     of signalling an error.  Also, restart R if there is an associated
     process which is not running.  However, do not start R just via the
     "electric" '(' ('ess-r-args-auto-show').
   * ESS[S]: For (one-line) functions withOUT '{ ..  }' bodys, the end
     of function is now correctly found more often.  This notably
     improves 'C-c C-c' ('ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step').
   * ESS[JAGS]: cleanup/re-organization of elisp code; symbolic links
     for CODA output are now only created by the new JAGS 'system'
     command in version 1.0.3; specify whether this command is available
     via 'ess-jags-system'; if not present, then no links are created so
     that the '*shell*' buffer does not become unresponsive during the
     batch run

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.7:
   * ESS: 'ess-default-style' now *is* customizable, i.e., changing its
     value in '~/.emacs' now does have the desired effect.
   * ESS: 'ess-font-lock-mode' is a new variable (default: t) which
     controls whether font-locking is enabled in ESS buffers.
   * ESS[R]: for XEmacs on Windows; another tweak to find R versions
   * ESS[SAS]: font-locking updated for ODS and SAS Bayesian Procedures;
     a more consistent handling of SAS options by
     'ess-sas-submit-command-options' which is buffer-local; portable
     snooze for MS Windows via customize-able 'ess-sleep-for' (floats
     welcome); Xpdf now supported as a PDF viewer
   * ESS[Rnw]: now also works with "emacs -nw" and Emacs 22.
   * ESS[JAGS]: now requires JAGS 1.0 (see the new ESS for JAGS help
     section for more information): both need work; suggestions welcome
   * ESS[R]: [TAB] completion now uses the R-internal completion
     mechanism (for R >= 2.5.0).
   * ESS[R] ([S]): interpretation of "_" as assignment has been removed
     in 'ess-continued-statement-p' for R and S.
   * several internal code cleanups.
   * ESS[R]: An experimental version of a new command 'Rgui' on MS
     Windows to send lines directly from emacs to 'Rgui' is available in
     file 'lisp/essd-rgui.el'.  Preliminary documentation is in file
     'doc/rgui-doc.txt'.

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.6:
   * ESS: for XEmacs, using "gnuclient" (without a "-q") works for
     things like fix() after M-x gnuserv-start has been done.
   * ESS[R]: M-x R-newest should now work in more situations on MS
     Windows, e.g., when R has been installed in a non-default
     "ProgramFiles" directory tree.  In these cases, there's no need to
     specify the name (and full path) of the R program anymore.
   * ESS[R]: For XEmacs, startup (with new tooltip code) works again.

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.5:
   * ESS[R] a new defun is available, 'M-x R-newest', which will start
     the newest version of R that it can find on your system.
   * ESS[R] add Sven Hartenstein's "R function arguments tips"
     functionality, via new file '../lisp/essd-r-args.el'.  Note that
     this includes an "electric "("" behavior inside 'R-mode' which is
     _active by default_ and can be customized via
     'ess-r-args-electric-paren'; i.e., use '(setq
     ess-r-args-electric-paren nil)' to turn it off.  Further,
     'ess-r-args-show-as' allows to switch to the "tooltip" mode.
   * ESS: functions 'ess-get-pdf-viewer' and *-ps-viewer; built on new
     customizable variables 'ess-pdf-viewer-pref' and
     'ess-ps-viewer-pref'; currently used in 'ess-swv-PDF' and '*-PS'.
   * ESS[R] Improved 'ess-swv-PDF' to run pdf viewer only if pdflatex
     was ok
   * ESS[R] Improved 'ess-swv-weave' to start R automatically if none is
     running.
   * ESS: Do no longer ask _which_ ESS process to use if there is only
     one.

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.4:
   * ESS[R] now better work with options(error=recover); and the new
     default of CHM help files on windows.
   * ESS[R] some more cleanup in the "sweave" functions
   * miscellaneous fixes

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.3:
   * ESS[S] fix buglet (5.3.2 only) which left command prompt in
     "execute buffer" and hence help files.
   * new customizable variable 'ess-display-buffer-reuse-frames' set to
     true (which changes default behavior) such that execution or help
     *frames* are reused.

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.2:
   * Classic BUGS now supported by '(require 'essd-bugs)' with ESS[BUGS]
     and JAGS by '(require 'essd-jags)' with ESS[JAGS].  But, only one
     of them can be used at a time since they don't play nice together.
     Also, 'C-c C-c' is now bound to the function 'ess-bugs-next-action'
     ('F12' has been retired).  And finally, note that 'essl-bug.el' is
     deprecated and the replacement is 'essl-bugs.el'.
   * ESS[R] Improved some of the "Sweave-make" functions (yet scarcely
     documented) in 'ess-swv.el'.
   * ESS[S] No longer mess with .Last.value (nor in other "languages").

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.1:
   * See the docs for 2 ways to install ESS for XEmacs
       1. by uncommenting the XEmacs part of Section 1 of 'Makeconf' and
          performing 'make install'
       2. by unpacking either 'ess-5.3.1.tgz' or 'ess-5.3.1.zip' into
          'PREFIX/lib/xemacs/site-packages' on unix or
          'PREFIX\XEmacs\site-packages' on windows
   * ESS[R]: fixed bugs so that Rterm.exe can be found by XEmacs
   * ESS[S]: 'ess-toggle-S-assign-key' is slightly changed; in
     particular, the default 'ess-assign-key' is now 'C-x ='.
   * ESS[R]: 'M-x R-site-search' is a new (slightly experimental)
     utility similar to R's 'RSiteSearch(..)' but with the advantage of
     using Emacs' preferred browser, see 'browse-url-browser-function'

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.0:
   * ESS[BUGS]: sanely re-format statistical output, '.bog', from
     scientific notation to numbers rounded with 4 decimal places with
     'M-x ess-bugs-sci-round-to-4-dp'.
   * The keys for navigating among section headings in help buffers
     worked, but only for one language per session; they should now work
     for multiple languages.  (They were also broken on Windows
     machines.)
   * ESS[S] long standing buglets in the internal logic for loading lisp
     code on Windows.  Particularly fixed behavior in help mode with
     S-plus GUI.
   * New variable, 'ess-use-inferior-program-name-in-buffer-name', which
     enables using the executable name instead of the dialect name for
     R. Feature request.
   * ESS[S] 'ess-execute-screen-options' now also works correctly when
     there is more than one window *side-by-side* in the same frame and
     runs in the correct buffer also when there is more than one S
     buffer.
   * iESS[S] new functions 'ess-eval-paragraph-and-step' and
     'ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step' are bound to keys 'C-c
     C-p' and 'C-c C-c' respectively and to the menu in ESS-mode; also
     bound in the help mode (for evaluating examples).
   * ESS[S] new function 'ess-toggle-S-assign-key' allows to assign the
     " <- " insertion to an arbitrary key.

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.12:
   * ESS[SAS]: 'M-;' fixed, but the XEmacs function 'comment-dwim' may
     be broken, if so, use 'M-x comment-region' and 'M-x
     uncomment-region' instead; only valid PROCs are fontified which is
     very helpful finding syntax errors (currently supported: BASE, ETS,
     FSP, GRAPH, IML, INSIGHT and STAT); the "feature" where 'F'-keys
     take you to an empty buffer when the requested destination is a
     file that does not exist has been fixed, now the request results in
     a no-op.  Further, sas-mode now also works in simple terminals.
   * Rterm/Cygwin combination works under Microsoft Windows.
   * ESS[R]: internal calls use baseenv() instead of NULL and define
     'baseenv' where needed.
   * New experimental support for installing ESS. See the file
     'lisp/ess-install.el'.

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.11:
   * ESS Info entry and 'dir' handled more effectively for GNU Emacs
     users
   * ESS[SAS]: temporary files created for batch submission of a region
     are now named based on the current file; see 'ess-sas-file-root'
     for details; all 'lag' and 'dif' functions now fontified correctly
   * iESS[SAS]: fixed a few nagging bugs, however, still does not appear
     to work at this time; please let us know if you have any ideas.
   * ESS[S]: Support for running other versions of Splus has been added
     for unix.  Two new variables, 'ess-s-versions' and
     'ess-s-versions-list', are used to tell ESS what other versions of
     Splus you would like to run.

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.10:
   * ESS[R]: ess-r-versions can no longer be customized (since the
     customization was not taking effect unless customizations were
     loaded before ESS). Its value has been changed so that it will also
     find R executables beginning "R-devel" and "R-patched".  If you
     wish to change this variable, it must be set in your '.emacs'
     before ESS is loaded.
   * Installation with GNU Make enhanced: unix and unix-like operating
     systems will now be able to install ESS for all users in either a
     GNU Emacs site-lisp or an XEmacs package configuration by editing
     'lisp/ess-site.el' and 'Makeconf' accordingly, then issuing 'make
     install'
   * ESS[S]: Filename completion (inside strings) now also works in
     XEmacs for R and S-plus.

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.9:
   * ESS[R] for Windows: the \ directory character bug with respect to
     ess-load-file has been eradicated.
   * iESS[SAS]: 'C-c C-r' and 'C-c C-b' once again work as intended and
     documented.
   * ESS[S]: M-x ess-fix-EQ-assign is a bit more agressive.
   * ESS[S]: Imenu now also shows setAs(), etc.
   * ESS[R]: R function pattern enhanced with underlying code such that
     'M-C-a' ('ess-beginning-of-function') etc now work for many more
     cases, including S4 method definitions.
   * iESS[R]: myOwnhelp(1) no longer wrongly triggers help(1).
   * ESS[R]: Improved detection of bogus help buffers: valid help
     buffers containing with the string "no documentation"(e.g.
     contour) were being treated as bogus.
   * ESS[R]: In R help buffers, if 'options("help.try.all.packages" =
     TRUE)' then '?rlm' will list which packages rlm is defined in.
     This help buffer is not bogus, but instead is now relabelled
     "*help[R](rlm in packages)*".
   * ESS[STA]: add "//" as comment starting character to syntax-table.

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.8:
   * iESS: [Tab] completes *file* names "inside string" as in earlier
     (<= 5.2.3) ESS versions.

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.7:
   * If you use Custom to change the variable ess-toolbar-items, the new
     toolbar is used in all subsequent ESS buffers.
   * ESS[SAS]: new feature: if ess-sas-log-max >0 and your .log grows to
     more than ess-sas-log-max bytes, just the first ess-sas-log-max
     bytes are refreshed; this is helpful when your .sas program
     generates lots of error messages and gets too big for emacs to
     display
   * ESS[R/S]: 'M-;' in R/S editing modes will now indent with either
     one or two hashes depending on context.
   * ESS[R]: David Whiting's Sweave extensions (to 'noweb') are now
     available (from ess-swv.el loaded by default).

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.6:
   * Removed non-ASCII characters in a few files.
   * ESS[R]: now works better when UTF-8 locale is active; in
     particular, you get correct directional quotes in R's startup
     message for R-devel (unstable development version of R 2.1.0) when
     using environment variables LANGUAGE=en@quot LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
   * ESS[SAS]: toggling of .log mode improved ('F10'); toggling of .lst
     mode now also available ('C-F10'); killing all buffers associated
     with .sas program no longer bound to 'C-F10' since its a bit
     overzealous.
   * S-Plus 7 for Windows is now recognized.
   * ESS[S] (incl. R): in auto-fill mode, strings are not wrapped
     anymore.
   * ESS[S] (incl. R): font-lock now correctly differs between R and S,
     e.g., for "_"; both now fontify warning(.)  and S does terminate()
     additionally.
   * Support for 'bell' aka 'beep' aka 'ding' aka 'alarm' in all
     inferior modes: When \a is output "to the the console" at the
     beginning of a line, the bell is rung.

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.5:
   * ESS[R]: 'C-c C-q' or 'Quit S' from the menu now should work (again
     and less klunkily) and do not append '-exited' to the buffer name.
     Further, the behavior of '(ess-cleanup)', called from ess-quit, now
     depends on the new customizable variable
     'ess-S-quit-kill-buffers-p' which defaults to 'nil'.  Consequently,
     the question _"Delete all buffers associated with ..?"_  will not
     be asked anymore by default.
   * ESS[SAS] - ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace will now work
     with the 'recode' application as well which is available on many
     platforms
   * ESS[S] (incl. R): Name completion for slots of S4 objects now
     works!

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.4:
   * The documentation now includes an overview of how to use the emacs
     TAGS facility for S functions.  (The distribution also used to
     contain a directory 'etc/other/Tags' where a ~1990 version of
     'etags.c' was distributed; this is no longer relevant and so has
     been deleted.)
   * ESS[SAS] - When you are working with EBCDIC files on an ASCII
     platform, .log NOTEs may display as gibberish since the EBCDIC
     characters are not converted to ASCII prior to their display.  So,
     the function ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace is provided for
     convenience and is bound to 'C-F11'.  This function requires the
     'dd' command (only available on unix or unix-like platforms).
   * ESS: Completion of object names is now always done dynamically
     rather than allowing the option of using a pre-computed database
     (by 'ess-create-object-name-db') since modern computers seem fast
     enough for dynamic completion.  (We expect few users, if any, have
     been using the pre-computed database method.)
   * ESS: object completion in iESS buffers running on Windows was very
     slow (for GNU Emacs, but not XEmacs) and has now been fixed.
     Further, it was more or less broken for all versions of S-plus 6.x,
     and has been fixed to work everywhere but with the Windows' GUI of
     S-plus.  The list of objects now shows unique names also when an
     object appears more than once in the search path.
   * ESS[R]: Completion of object names now also includes those starting
     with ".".

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.3:
   * ESS: When new inferior ESS processes are created, by default they
     will replace the current buffer (this restores behavior from pre
     5.2.0).  If you wish new ESS processes to start in another window
     of the current frame, set inferior-ess-same-window to nil.
   * New variables inferior-Splus-args and inferior-R-args provide a way
     to pass command line arguments to starting S and R processes.

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.2:
   * bug-fixes for 5.2.1 (require 'executable), html docs, etc.
   * ess-lisp-directory/../doc/info added to Info-directory-list if
     ess-info not found by info
   * ESS[R]: If you have other versions of R on your exec-path, such as
     "R-1.8.1" with Unix or "rw1081" with Windows, ESS will find them
     and create appropriate functions, such as 'M-x R-1.8.1' or 'M-x
     rw1081', for calling them.  By default only Unix programs beginning
     "R-1" and "R-2" and Windows programs parallel to the version of R
     in your exec-path will be found, but see ess-r-versions and
     ess-rterm-versions for ways to find other versions of R.
   * ESS[R]: Other versions of R, such as "R-1.8.1" on Unix and "rw1081"
     on Windows, are added to the "ESS / Start Process / Other" menu.
   * ESS[S]: If you have other versions of S-Plus on your Windows
     computer, such as S-Plus 6.1 or S-Plus 4.5, ESS will find them and
     create appropriate functions, such as 'M-x splus61', for calling
     the console version (Sqpe) inside an emacs buffer.  By default only
     programs installed in the default location will be found, but see
     ess-SHOME-versions for ways to find other versions of S-Plus.
   * ESS[S]: Other versions of Sqpe on Windows, such as "splus61", are
     added to the "ESS / Start Process / Other" menu.
   * ESS[R]: (bug fix) ess-quit (bound to 'C-c C-q') should now quit the
     inferior R process, when issued from either the inferior buffer, or
     from a .R buffer.

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.1:
   * ESS[S] (R and S-plus): now have toolbar support with icons to
     evaluate code in the inferior process or to switch there.  This
     code is experimental and likely to change as XEmacs/Emacs issues
     get resolved.  The toolbar should be enabled if your Emacs displays
     images, but can be disabled with the variable ess-use-toolbar.
     Thanks to David Smith from Insightful for the S-plus logo.
   * ESS[SAS]: ess-sas-graph-view ('F12') enhanced; you can specify
     external file viewers for each graphics file type via the alist
     ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist; also .jpg/.gif are now handled by
     image-mode on XEmacs, if available, otherwise by graphics
     primitives as before

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.0:
   * ESS[BUGS]: new info documentation!  now supports interactive
     processing thanks to Aki Vehtari (mailto:Aki.Vehtari@hut.fi); new
     architecture-independent unix support as well as support for BUGS
     v.  0.5
   * ESS[SAS]: convert .log to .sas with ess-sas-transcript; info
     documentation improved; Local Variable bug fixes; SAS/IML
     statements/functions now highlighted; files edited remotely by
     ange-ftp/EFS/tramp are recognized and pressing SUBMIT opens a
     buffer on the remote host via the local variable
     ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init which defaults to "ssh"; changed
     the definition of the variable ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle to boolean
     rather than 0/1; added the function ess-electric-run-semicolon
     which automatically reverse indents lines containing only "run;";
     'C-F1' creates MS RTF portrait from the current buffer; 'C-F2'
     creates MS RTF landscape from the current buffer; 'C-F9' opens a
     SAS DATASET with PROC INSIGHT rather than PROC FSVIEW; "inferior"
     aliases for SAS batch: 'C-c C-r' for submit region, 'C-c C-b' for
     submit buffer, 'C-c C-x' for goto .log; 'C-c C-y' for goto .lst
   * ESS[S]: Pressing underscore ("_") once inserts " <- " (as before);
     pressing underscore twice inserts a literal underscore.  To stop
     this smart behaviour, add "(ess-toggle-underscore nil)" to your
     .emacs after ess-site has been loaded;
     ess-dump-filename-template-proto (new name!)  now can be customized
     successfully (for S language dialects); Support for Imenu has been
     improved; set ess-imenu-use-S to non-nil to get an "Imenu-S" item
     on your menubar; ess-help: Now using nice underlines (instead of
     'nuke-* ^H_')
   * ESS[R]: After (require 'essa-r), 'M-x ess-r-var' allows to load
     numbers from any Emacs buffer into an existing *R* process; 'M-x
     ess-rdired' gives a "directory editor" of R objects; fixed
     ess-retr-lastvalue-command, i.e.  .Last.value bug (thanks to David
     Brahm)
   * ESS: Support for creating new window frames has been added to ESS.
     Inferior ESS processes can be created in dedicated frames by
     setting inferior-ess-own-frame to t.  ESS help buffers can also
     open in new frames; see the documentation for ess-help-own-frame
     for details.  (Thanks to Kevin Rodgers for contributing code.)

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.24:
   * The version number is now correct even inside ESS/Emacs

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.23:
   * Minor more Makefile clean up.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:
   * Besides info documentation, PDF and HTML documentation are also
     provided (instead of built using "make") and available on the web
     as well; see ESS web page (http://ess.r-project.org/) and StatLib
     (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/doc)
   * Now that info documentation is available, the README.* files are no
     longer supported.  However, they are still distributed for what
     it's worth.
   * ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See XEmacs Installation HOWTO
     (http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html) for details
     (specifically, items 10-15).
   * ESS[SAS]: more user-friendly enhancements for remote SAS batch jobs
     with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT function key features
     now supported).  Multiple shells now supported so you can run SAS
     on different computers from different buffers by setting the
     buffer-local variable ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer names.
   * Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:
   * ESS[SAS]: info documentation now available!, see ESS->Help for SAS;
     'F12' opens GSASFILE nearest point for viewing either within emacs,
     when available, or via an external viewer; more syntax highlighting
     keywords; more enhancements for remote SAS batch jobs with Kermit;
     new framework for remote SAS interactive jobs, see ess-remote
   * ESS[S]: info documentation now available!, see ESS->Help for the S
     family
   * Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files made by
     doc/Makefile and installed in new info sub-directory

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:
   * New 'options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R). The S
     program can determine the environment in which it is currently
     running.  ESS sets the option to 'iESS' or 'ddeESS' when it starts
     an S language process.  We recommend other specific values for S
     language processes that ESS does not start.
   * New 'ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default.
     User may click on a word or region and then choose from the menu to
     display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc.  This feature is
     still under development.
   * GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS & BUGS),
     (some from Stephen Eglen).
   * XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)
   * XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported.
   * Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win).
   * should now work even when imenu is not available (for old
     XEmacsen).
   * ESS[SAS]: XEmacs-Imenu fix; 'C-TAB' is globalized along with your
     function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify your SAS
     library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for ess-sas-data-view
     with SAS code placed in the variable ess-sas-data-view-libname,
     also the dataset name is defaulted to the nearest permanent dataset
     to point; Speedbar support now works for permanent datasets, please
     ignore first./last.; new font-locking is now the default with more
     improvements for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
     comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with 'F10' which will
     font-lock your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas files
     accessed with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is experimental) by
     setting ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh; ess-sas-submit-command and
     ess-sas-submit-command-options are buffer-local so you can have
     local file variable sections at the end of your .sas files to
     request different executables or specify special options and the
     local file variables are re-read at submit instead of only at file
     open so that if you make a change it is picked up immediately;
   * ESS[BUGS]: font-lock with 'in' fixed.
   * for STATA: font-lock bug fixed.
   * for Rd mode: 'C-c C-v' and 'switch-process' in menu.  further, 'C-c
     C-f' prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or surrounding a word by things
     such as \code{.}, \code{\link{.}}, \emph{.} etc.
   * new functions (ess-directory-function) and (ess-narrow-to-defun)
     ess-directory <-> default-directory logic (Jeff Mincy).
   * Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.19:
   * S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger
     (Windows))
   * New BUGS support through ESS[BUGS] mode (Rodney Sparapani)
     Templates assist you in writing .bug and .cmd code (.cmd and .log
     are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension collisions).
     Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic" generation of
     data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const N=" from your data
     file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.  Activated by pressing
     'F12'.
   * Fixes for 'ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)
   * You can change between PC and Unix, local and global SAS
     function-key definitions interactively (Rich Heiberger)
   * 'C-Submit' a highlighted region to SAS batch (Rodney Sparapani)
   * New and improved SAS syntax highlighting (Rodney Sparapani) To get
     the new functionality, set ess-sas-run-make-regexp to nil.  Also
     available in .log files via 'F10'.
   * Open a permanent SAS dataset for viewing via 'F9' (Rodney
     Sparapani) You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas for it
     to work.
   * User-friendly defaults for 'sas-program',
     'ess-sas-batch-pre-command' and 'ess-sas-batch-post-command' as
     well Customize support for these and other ESS[SAS] variables
     (Rodney Sparapani)
   * 'ess-sas-suffix-2' now defaults to .dat via 'F11' (Rodney
     Sparapani)
   * Emacs/XEmacs, Unix/Windows issues collectively handled in
     ess-emcs.el
   * defadvice solves problem of missing *ESS* (thanks to Jeff Mincy)
   * Improved manual a bit by including things that were only in
     'README'.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.18:
   * New 'ess-smart-underscore' function, now assigned to "_" by
     default.  Inserts 'ess-S-assign' (customizable " <- "), unless
     inside string and comments where plain "_" is used instead.  (MM)
   * Fixes for longstanding interactive SAS breakage (RMH)

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.17:
   * Documentation for Windows Installation (Rich Heiberger)
   * removal of ess-vars, finalization of customize support (in the
     sense that there is no more use of ess-vars, but that we need to
     fix ess-cust) (AJ Rossini)
   * Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler)
   * addition of the "S-equal" variable and provide 'M-x
     ess-add-MM-keys' a way to remap "_" to 'ess-S-assign', typically "
     <- ", but customizable.  (MMaechler)

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.16:
   * BUG FIXES
   * Better SAS support

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.15:
   * BUG FIXES

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.14:
   * Yet more fixes to SAS mode, (Rich Heiberger and Rodney Sparapani)
   * Customize support (for most Emacsen which support it) (AJRossini)
   * ARC and ViSta support out of the box, and fixes for XLispStat
     (AJRossini)

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.13:
   * Version numbering finally all depending on the ./VERSION file,
     thanks to Martin Maechler.
   * Yet more fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rich Heiberger.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.12:
   * Splus 5.1 stabilized, thanks to Martin Maechler, Bill Venables,
     Chuck Taylor, and others.
   * More fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rodney Sparapani and Rich
     Heiberger.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.11:
   * More fixes to Stata mode, thanks to Brendan Halpin
     (mailto:brendan@essex.ac.uk).
   * fixed bugs in ESS-elsewhere, thanks to many testers
   * README.SPLUS4WIN has DETAILED instructions for S-PLUS 2000, thanks
     to David Brahm (mailto:brahm@alum.mit.edu).
   * Fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rodney Sparapani

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.10:
   * More fixes to Stata mode
   * primitive generic version of ESS-elsewhere
   * Small fixes to SAS/Stata.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.9:
   * Stata mode works
   * Literate Data Analysis using Noweb works

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.8:
   * Bug fixes
   * R documentation mode defaults changed

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.2:
   * able to use inferior iESS mode to communicate directly with a
     running S-Plus 4.x process using the Microsoft DDE protocol.  We
     use the familiar (from Unix ESS) 'C-c C-n' and related key
     sequences to send lines from the S-mode file to the inferior S
     process.  We continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode and
     transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All
     three modes know the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns
     and provide the syntactic highlighting that eases the programming
     tasks.
