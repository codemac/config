List of regexps which will be added to `auto-mode-alist' (associated to `gmail-message-mode').

If the file path matches any of these, `gmail-message-mode' will be
activated on the current file.

If you don't want `gmail-message-mode' to add itself to your
`auto-mode-alist' simply set this variable to nil.

If you add items manually (not through the customization
interface), you'll need to call `gmm/set-amlist' for it
to take effect.
Removing items only takes effect after restarting Emacs.")

Not actually meant for editing. This just sets up the buffer as a
mirrored version of an html file that you'll be editing with the
actual `gmail-message-mode'.

This is supposed to be added to `edit-server-url-major-mode-alist',
so that it's called in an edit-server buffer. If you're trying to
use this in any other way, you're probably using the wrong
function. Try using (or extending) `gmail-message-mode' instead.

(autoload 'gmail-message-client-mode "gmail-message-mode" "\
Designed for GMail messages coming from google-chrome's \"Edit with Emacs\".

This mode is meant for editing, it is the sister of
`gmail-message-edit-server-mode', which is not meant for editing.
It works exactly as the simpler `gmail-message-mode', except that
saving or killing this buffer also affects the edit-server's
buffer (which is the mirror of this one).

This is supposed to be added to `auto-mode-alist', so that it's
called when we open mirror files setup by
`gmail-message-edit-server-mode'. If you're trying to use this in
any other way, you're probably using the wrong function. Try
using (or extending) `gmail-message-mode' instead.
