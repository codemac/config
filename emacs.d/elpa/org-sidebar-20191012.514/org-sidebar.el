;;; org-sidebar.el --- Helpful sidebar for Org buffers  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; URL: https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sidebar
;; Package-Version: 20191012.514
;; Version: 0.3-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.1") (s "1.10.0") (dash "2.13") (dash-functional "1.2.0") (org "9.0") (org-ql "0.2") (org-super-agenda "1.0"))
;; Keywords: hypermedia, outlines, Org, agenda

;;; Commentary:

;; This package presents a helpful sidebar view for Org buffers.
;; Sidebars are customizable using `org-ql' queries and
;; `org-super-agenda' grouping.

;; The default view includes a chronological list of scheduled and
;; deadlined tasks in the current buffer (similar to the Org agenda
;; ,but without all its features) at the top, and a list of all other
;; non-done to-do items below.  If the buffer is narrowed, the sidebar
;; only shows items in the narrowed portion; this allows seeing an
;; overview of tasks in a subtree.

;;;; Usage

;; Call these commands to display sidebars:

;; - `org-sidebar:' Display the default item sidebars for the current
;;                  Org buffer.
;; - `org-sidebar-tree:' Display tree-view sidebar for current Org
;;                       buffer.

;; Toggling versions of those commands are also available:

;; - `org-sidebar-toggle'
;; - `org-sidebar-tree-toggle'

;; Customization options are in the `org-sidebar' group.

;; The functions `org-sidebar-tree-view-buffer' and
;; `org-sidebar--subtree-buffer' return buffers.

;; To display custom-defined sidebars, call the function `org-sidebar'
;; with the arguments described in its docstring.  See examples in
;; documentation, as well as the definitions of functions
;; `org-sidebar--todo-items' and `org-sidebar--upcoming-items'.
