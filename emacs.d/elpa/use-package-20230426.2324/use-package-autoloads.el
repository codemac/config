Load PACKAGE and bind key sequence invoking this function to KEYMAP-SYMBOL.
Then simulate pressing the same key sequence a again, so that the
next key pressed is routed to the newly loaded keymap.

This function supports use-package's :bind-keymap keyword.  It
works by binding the given key sequence to an invocation of this
function for a particular keymap.  The keymap is expected to be
defined by the package.  In this way, loading the package is
deferred until the prefix key sequence is pressed.

;;; Generated autoloads from use-package-core.el

(autoload 'use-package "use-package-core" "\
Declare an Emacs package by specifying a group of configuration options.

For the full documentation, see Info node `(use-package) top'.
Usage:

  (use-package package-name
     [:keyword [option]]...)

:init            Code to run before PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.
:config          Code to run after PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.  Note that
                 if loading is deferred for any reason, this code does not
                 execute until the lazy load has occurred.
:preface         Code to be run before everything except `:disabled'; this
                 can be used to define functions for use in `:if', or that
                 should be seen by the byte-compiler.

:mode            Form to be added to `auto-mode-alist'.
:magic           Form to be added to `magic-mode-alist'.
:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:commands        Define autoloads for commands that will be defined by the
                 package.  This is useful if the package is being lazily
                 loaded, and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:autoload        Similar to :commands, but it for no-interactive one.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
                 *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the
                 package.  This is like `:bind', but for keymaps.
:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:defer           Defer loading of a package -- this is implied when using
                 `:commands', `:bind', `:bind*', `:mode', `:magic', `:hook',
                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:after           Delay the effect of the use-package declaration
                 until after the named libraries have loaded.
                 Before they have been loaded, no other keyword
                 has any effect at all, and once they have been
                 loaded it is as if `:after' was not specified.

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `Custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable
                 definition without modifying the Emacs `custom-file'.
                 (compare with `custom-set-variables').
:custom-face     Call `custom-set-faces' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin             Pin the package to an archive.
