INTRODUCTION


What's this?

It is a minor mode for Emacs. It can help you to move your cursor
to ANY position in emacs by using only 3 times key press.

Where does ace jump mode come from ?

I firstly see such kind of moving style is in a vim plugin called
EasyMotion. It really attract me a lot. So I decide to write
one for Emacs and MAKE IT BETTER.

So I want to thank to :
        Bartlomiej P.   for his PreciseJump
        Kim Silkeb√¶kken for his EasyMotion


What's ace-jump-mode ?

ace-jump-mode is an fast/direct cursor location minor mode. It will
create the N-Branch search tree internal and marks all the possible
position with predefined keys in within the whole emacs view.
Allowing you to move to the character/word/line almost directly.


Usage

Add the following code to your init file, of course you can select
the key that you prefer to.
