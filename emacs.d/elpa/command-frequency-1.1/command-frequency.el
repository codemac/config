;;{{{ DESCRIPTION:
;; This package provides function which saves how many times each
;; command was executed.  You can then review those statistics to see
;; which commands you use the most often.
;;
;; It is used in designing a ergonomic keybinding set.
;; See http://xahlee.org/emacs/command-frequency.html
;;}}}

;;{{{ INSTALLATION
;; To install this package, do the following:
;; 1. Save this file in your favorite dir. For example: 
;;    ~/Documents/emacs/command-frequency.el
;; 2. put the following line in your .emacs file:
;;   ;; make emacs aware of the file path
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/Documents/emacs")
;;
;;   ;; make emacs aware of this package
;;   (require 'command-frequency)
;;
;;   ;; load the program
;;   (command-frequency-mode 1)
;;}}}

;;{{{ USAGE
;; Type Alt+x command-frequency-mode to load it, if not already loaded.
;; When you want to know the command frequency, type Alt+x command-frequency.
;;
;; You can also put the following lines in your .emacs:
;;     (require 'command-frequency)
;;     (command-frequency-table-load)
;;     (command-frequency-mode 1)
;;     (command-frequency-autosave-mode 1)
;;}}}
 
;;{{{ CUSTOMIZATION
;; All customizable variables are in command-frequency custom group so
;; you can edit them there if you want.  What is worth mentioning at
;; this point is that by enabling `command-frequency-autosave-mode'
;; modifying `command-frequency-autosave-destinations' you can make
;; this mode publsh your statistics on a web site, eg:
;;
;;     (defun my-command-frequency-html-row-format (num percent command)
;;       (format "\t<tr><td>%d</td><td>%.2f%%</td><td>%s</td></tr>\n"
;;               num percent command))
;;
;;     (setq command-frequency-autosave-destinations
;;           (list
;;            nil  ; save in sexp format in `command-frequency-table-file'
;;            ("~/public_html/command-frequency.txt" nil nil t)
;;              ; save in given file as plain text with pecentage
;;            ("~/public_html/command-frequency" nil nil
;;             'my-command-frequency-html-row-format)
;;              ; save in given file in custom format
;;           )
;;
;;}}}

;; {{{VERSION HISTORY
;; Version 1.1, 2008-09: Replaced the use of this-command var by real-last-command, so that the commands backward-kill-word, kill-word, kill-line, kill-region, do not all get counted as kill-region. Changed post-command-hook to pre-command-hook
;; Version 1.0, 2007: Made into a full featured minor mode. Added full doc strings. Added feature to save and read to disk the frequency hash table. Added ability to set user preference using emacs's customization system. Code is ~400 lines. This version is made by Michal Nazarewicz in 2007.
;; Version 0.1, 2006: First version by Ryan Yeske. A quick hack of about 40 lines.
