1 General Information: README
*****************************

This is the README file for the distribution of ESS version 14.11

   ESS is a GNU Emacs and XEmacs mode for interactive statistical
programming and data analysis.  Languages supported: the S family (S,
S-PLUS and R), SAS, BUGS/JAGS and Stata.  ESS grew out of the desire for
bug fixes and extensions to S-mode and SAS-mode as well as a consistent
union of their features in one package.

   Installation instructions are provided in sections for both Unix and
Windows; see below.

   The current development team is led by Martin Maechler since August
2004.  Former project leader A.J. (Tony) Rossini
(<rossini@blindglobe.net>) did the initial port to XEmacs and has been
the primary coder.  Martin Maechler (<maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>) and
Kurt Hornik (<Kurt.Hornik@R-project.org>) have assisted with the S
family and XLispStat.  Stephen Eglen (<stephen@gnu.org>) has worked
mostly on R support.  Richard M. Heiberger (<rmh@temple.edu>) has
assisted with S/S-PLUS development for Windows.  Richard and Rodney A.
Sparapani (<rsparapa@mcw.edu>) have done much of the work improving SAS
batch and interactive support.  Rodney has also extended ESS to support
BUGS/JAGS and has an interest in improving Stata support.

   We are grateful to the previous developers of S-mode (Doug Bates, Ed
Kademan, Frank Ritter, David M. Smith), SAS-mode (Tom Cook) and
Stata-mode (Thomas Lumley).

1.2 Stability
=============

All recent released versions are meant to be release-quality versions.
While some new features are being introduced, we are cleaning up and
improving the interface.  We know that there are many remaining
opportunities for documentation improvements, but all contributors are
volunteers and time is precious.  Patches or suggested fixes with bug
reports are much appreciated!


File: readme.info,  Node: Requirements,  Next: Latest Version,  Prev: Stability,  Up: General Information

1.3 Requirements
================

ESS is most likely to work with current/recent versions of the following
statistical packages: R/S-PLUS, SAS, Stata, OpenBUGS and JAGS.

   ESS supports current, and recent, stable versions of GNU Emacs
(currently, specifically, the 23.x and 24.x series;
alpha/beta/pre-release versions are NOT SUPPORTED). Non-Windows users
beware: GNU Emacs 24.3 is preferable to 24.1 or 24.2: these broken
builds suffer from bug 12463
<http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=12463> which will cause
emacs and ESS to get progressively slower over time.

   Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS requires, ESS support of
XEmacs ends with ESS 12.04-4.  This decision will be re-visited in the
future as XEmacs continues to sync with GNU Emacs.

   To build the PDF documentation, you will need a version of TeX Live
or texinfo that includes texi2dvi (BEWARE: recent TeX Live, and some
texinfo RPMs, do NOT include texi2dvi).

1.4 Getting the Latest Version
==============================

The latest released version of ESS is always available on the web at:
ESS web page (http://ess.r-project.org) or StatLib
(http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/)

1.4.1 ESS subversion repository
-------------------------------

The latest development version of ESS is available via
<https://svn.R-project.org/ESS/>, the ESS Subversion repository.  If you
have a Subversion client (see <http://subversion.tigris.org/>), you can
download the sources using:
     % svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk PATH
which will put the ESS files into directory PATH.  Later, within that
directory, 'svn update' will bring that directory up to date.
Windows-based tools such as TortoiseSVN are also available for
downloading the files.  Alternatively, you can browse the sources with a
web browser at: ESS SVN site (https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk).
However, please use a subversion client instead to minimize the load
when retrieving.

   If you remove other versions of ESS from your emacs load-path, you
can then use the development version by adding the following to .emacs:

     (load "/path/to/ess-svn/lisp/ess-site.el")

   Note that https is required, and that the SSL certificate for the
Subversion server of the R project is

     Certificate information:
      - General name: r-project.org
      - Serial number: 04:9D:4F:0D:53:03:DB
      - Valid: from  03/10/2014  to  03/10/2016
      - Issuer: Starfield Secure Certificate Authority - G2
                http://certs.starfieldtech.com/repository/
      - SHA1-Fingerprint: F5:15:96:DB:F1:2F:35:1B:96:06:C3:A4:2A:E2:80:78:76:4C:A4:30
      - MD5-Fingerprint: D8:7D:4F:8F:ED:92:65:EE:EE:A5:73:2D:BB:F6:35:E6

1.4.2 Git for development
-------------------------

For development and experimentation on new features, there is now a
GitHub branch for ESS, available at <https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS>.


File: readme.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Starting up,  Prev: Latest Version,  Up: General Information

1.5 Installation
================

  1. Download the latest zip or tgz archive from ESS downloads area
     (http://ess.r-project.org/index.php?Section=download) and unpack it
     into a directory where you would like ESS to reside.  We will
     denote this directory as '/path/to/ESS/' hereafter.

     Alternatively you can use 'svn' or 'git' to fetch the most recent
     development version to your local machine with:

          svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk /path/to/ESS

     or

          git clone https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS.git /path/to/ESS

  2. Optionally, compile elisp files and build the documentation with:
          cd /path/to/ESS/
          make
     Without this step, info, pdf and html documentation and reference
     card will not be available.

  3. Optionally, install into your local machine with 'make install'.
     You might need administrative privileges:

          make install

     The files are installed into '/usr/share/emacs' directory.  For
     this step to run correctly on Mac OS X, you will need to adjust the
     'PREFIX' path in 'Makeconf'.  The necessary code and instructions
     are commented in that file.

  4. If you have performed the 'make install' step from above, just add

          (require 'ess-site)

     to your '~/.emacs' file.  Otherwise, you should add
     '/path/to/ESS/lisp/' to your emacs load path and then load ESS with
     the following lines in your '~/.emacs':

          (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ESS/lisp/")
          (load "ess-site")

  5. Restart your Emacs and check that ESS was loaded from a correct
     location with 'M-x ess-version'.

   _Note for Windows and Mac OS X users:_ The most straightforward way
to install Emacs on your machine is by downloading all-in-one
(http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs/) Emacs binary by Vincent Goulet.

   _Note for XEmacs users:_ Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS
requires, ESS support of XEmacs ends with ESS 12.04-4.  This decision
will be re-visited in the future as XEmacs continues to sync with GNU
Emacs.

1.8 New Features
================

Changes / Selected Bug Fixes in 14.09:
   * ESS[Julia]: Executable is changed to 'julia'.
   * ESS[Julia]: Completion and help system was adjusted to Julia
     v.0.3.0.  Julia v.0.2.x is no more supported.
   * ESS[R]: Running R with 'gdb' debugger now works as expected
   * iESS: Inferior ESS buffers are now derived from 'comint-mode'
   * ESS[R]: 'ess-execute-screen-options' uses correct screen width in
     terminal sessions
   * ESS: 'ess-build-tags-for-directory' works when no TAGS file name
     was provided
   * ESS: 'ess-continued-statement-offset' is now respected everywhere
     except inside of the 'if' test condition.
   * ESS: New variable 'ess-first-continued-statement-offset' for
     indentation of the first line in multiline statements.
   * ESSR: Starting ',' in multiline statements indentation is now
     ignored to achieve a more pleasant alignment.
   * ESSR: Improved behavior of 'RET' in roxygen blocks.
   * ESS[R]: command cleaning with 'C-u C-u C-y' was broken with lines
     containing " + "
   * ESS[R]: fixed "empty watch window bug"
   * ESS[R]: don't ask for help location on ac-quick-help (request of
     github #81)
   * ESS[R]: "importClassesFrom" and "importMethodsFrom" were added to
     the list of two-parameter roxygen commands
   * ESS[R]: fix vignetes display and hyperlinks (were broken in
     13.09-1)
   * ESS[Julia]: recognize function names ending with !
   * ESS[Julia]: fix indentation of "for" comprehension syntax within
     brackets.

   Changes / Selected Bug Fixes in 13.09-1:
   * ess-remote and TRAMP: R support code is now downloaded in binary
     form instead of being injected from local machine.  The R code is
     stored in '~/.config/ESSR/' directory on the remote machine
   * TRAMP: PAGER environment variable is now correctly set to
     'inferior-ess-pager'
   * retrieval of help topics on remote machines is fixed
   * org-babel: source references of R code executed from org files
     correctly point to source references in original org files (version
     8.2.1 or higher of org-mode is required for this feature)
   * 'ess-execute' is now bound to 'C-c C-e C-e' in 'ess-extra-map'.
   * completion works again in 'ess-execute'
   * ESS[R]: 'head' and 'tail' methods were replaced by 'htsummary' in
     'ess-R-describe-object-at-point-commands'
   * ESS[roxygen]: evaluation commands now work in roxygen blocks.
     Leading comments are automatically removed before the evaluation
   * ESS[transcript]: 'Clean Region' now works with multiline
     statements; 'ess-transcript-clean-region' etc.  correctly treat
     multiline statements, i.e., no longer forgets the lines typically
     preceded by '+'
   * ESS[SAS]: Three features/fixes with special thanks to Matthew
     Fidler https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pulls/mlf176f2
     (https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pulls/mlf176f2).  Turn on SAS log
     mode when appropriate.  Indent comments and CARDS statement more
     appropriately.
   * ESS[SAS]: 'ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle' default returns to 'nil'
   * ESS[R]: support for 'prettify-symbols-mode': contribution from
     Rudiger Sonderfeld <https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pull/65>
   * ESS[SWV]: knitr now evaluates in the current frame
   * ESS[developer]: ess-developer doesn't kill open DESCRIPTION files
     anymore
   * ESS[roxygen]: 'ess-roxy-preview-HTML' is now on 'C-c C-o C-w' and
     'ess-roxy-preview-text' is now on 'C-c C-o C-t'
   * ESS: installation with 'make install' was simplified and should
     work out of the box on most *nix systems
   * ESS installation instructions simplified
   * fixed font-lock bug introduced in 13.09 that was causing very slow
     process output

   Changes/New Features in 13.09:
   * font-lock in process buffers doesn't "spill" over prompts.  Missing
     closing string delimiters should not cause wrong fontification of
     the following command input.
   * ESS[julia]: full features M-TAB completion and auto-complete
     support, which now works for modules, structures and data types.
   * ESS[julia]: a much better eldoc showing arguments of methods and
     data type constructors
   * ESS-developer:
        - ESS-developer work-flow pattern has been streamlined:
          ESS-developer is now automatically activated on per-file basis
          if the file is part of a developed package
          'ess-developer-packages'.  The old behavior (activation on
          per-process basis) is still available on 'M-x ess-developer'
          in a process buffer.
        - integration with 'devtools' package.  New command
          'ess-developer-load-package' calls 'load_all' on the package
          containing current file.  'ess-developer-add-package' now
          offers IDO menu completions with available loading methods,
          currently 'library', and 'load_all'.  Loading command can be
          customized with 'ess-developer-load-on-add-commands'.
   * 'TAB' now indents region if region is active (a contribution of
     Matthew Fidler in pull #41)
   * 'M-x ess-version' now reports full loading path and recognizes git
     and ELPA versions.
   * warning and error keyword are now highlighted with
     'font-lock-warning-face' as they should be, (for quite some time
     these keywords have been hijacked by compilation mode
     fontification).
   * eldoc: Eldoc now recognizes multiple processes.  If current process
     is busy, or current buffer is not associated with a process, eldoc
     picks its completions from the first available free process.
   * org-babel: evaluation is now org-friendly
   * help: new help buffers now try to reuse ess-help buffers.  This
     behavior is controlled by 'ess-help-reuse-window' custom variable.
   * help: ?foo pops IDO menu on multiple help files (so far it worked
     only for 'C-c C-v')
   * remote evaluation is considerably faster now on slow connections
   * ESS[R] tracebug R source references regular expressions are
     (mostly) language agnostic.
   * 'ess-function-call-face' inherits from
     'font-lock-function-name-face' rather than
     'font-lock-builtin-face'.
   * 'ess-inject-source' now accepts 'function-and-buffer' option.
   * Documentation: The "New Features" section (and 'NEWS') now
     represent recent changes: within the last year or so.  All changes
     can be found in the new news.html (news.html) (or 'NEWS' and
     'ONEWS').
   * ESS[R] 'ess-rep-regexp' should no longer inf.loop (rarely!), and
     hence 'M-x ess-fix-miscellaneous' should neither.

   Changes/New Features in 13.05:
   * ESS[gretl]: Support for 'gretl' (both editing and sub-process
     interaction).  A contribution of Ahmadou Dicko.
   * ESS: process output display is 4-10 times faster due to new caching
     and only occasional emacs re-display (for the moment this
     functionality is available only when 'ess-tracebug' is active).
   * ESS: 'C-c `' is now bound to 'ess-show-traceback' and 'C-c ~' is
     bound to 'ess-show-call-stack'.
   * ESS[R]: ESS stores function in 'ESSR' environment to avoid kludging
     users' global environment and accidental deletion.
   * ESS[R]: new variable 'ess-swv-processing-command' to control
     weaving and tangling.
   * ESS[R]: 'ess-default-style' has been changed (from 'DEFAULT') to
     'RRR'.  Use something like '(setq ess-default-style 'DEFAULT)' or
     '(setq ess-indent-level 2)' in your '~/.emacs' equivalent _before_
     loading ESS, if you do not like this new "incompatible" default
     style.
   * ESS[julia]: ESS stores its functions in 'ESS' module.
   * ESS[julia]: Eldoc is now supported in julia modes
   * ESS[julia]: Adjusted error reference detection and interactive help
     to julia internal changes
   * ESS[R]: 'ess-use-tracebug''s default has been changed to 't'.  Set
     it to nil if you want to keep the previous behavior.
   * ESS[tracebug]: Electric debug keys have been removed [breaking
     change] The functionality was replaced with 'ess-debug-minor-mode'
     and 'ess-debug-minor-mode-map'.
   * ESS[tracebug]: 'ess-tracebug-map' is an alias to 'ess-dev-map' 'C-c
     C-t'.
   * ESS[tracebug]: 'ess-bp-toggle-state' ('C-c C-t o') can now be used
     during the debug session to toggle breakpoints on the fly
     (suggestion by Ross Boylan).
   * ESS[tracebug]: 'ess-debug-flag-for-debugging' and
     'ess-debug-unflag-for-debugging' work correctly from the debugging
     contexts.  These commands also recognize non-exported functions for
     the packages listed in 'ess-developer-packages' ('C-c C-t C-a').

   * ESS[R]: Eldoc (activated by 'ess-use-eldoc') has become more
     sophisticated, and hence also more intruding in the interface
     between the Statistics softare, e.g., R, and the user.

     Note that you can turn off ElDoc, by placing '(setq ess-use-eldoc
     nil)' in your '~/.emacs' file, prior to loading ESS,

   * ESS[SAS]: long over-looked 'SAS-mode-hook' appears!
   * ESS[SAS]: 'ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle' now defaults to 't' since
     'sas-indent-line' is still broken, i.e.  'TAB' is now bound to
     'ess-sas-tab-to-tab-stop' by default

   Changes/Bug Fixes in 12.09-2:
   * ESS: new 'ess-switch-to-end-of-proc-buffer' variable that controls
     whether 'C-c C-z' switches to the end of process buffer.  The
     default is 't'.  You can use prefix argument to 'C-c C-z' to toggle
     this variable.
   * ESS: fix in 'ess-eval-linewise' that was causing emacs to hang
     during R debugging with 'ess-eval-visibly' equal to 't'.
   * ESS: fix in 'ess-eval-linewise' that was causing emacs to recenter
     the prompt in visible window
   * ESS[tracebug]: A better handling of "Selection" prompts and debug
     related singlekey commands.
   * ESS: fix a bug in 'ess-switch-process' that was causing '*new*'
     selection to fail.
   * ESS[R]: Solve missing 'ess-local-process-name' bug in R-dired.
   * ESS[SWV]: 'ess-swv-PDF' doesn't ask for a command to run if there
     is only one command in 'ess-swv-pdflatex-commands'.
   * ESS[SWV]: 'ess-swv-weave' gained an universal argument to allow for
     an interactive choice between available weavers (sweave, knitr).
   * ESS: 'ess-eval-*-and-step' functions go to next empty line at eob,
     instead of staying at the last line.

   Changes/New Features in 12.09-1:
   * ESS _Breaking Changes in Keys_:

        - New keymaps: 'ess-doc-map' bound to 'C-c C-d'; 'ess-extra-map'
          bound to 'C-c C-e'; 'ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer' was
          moved on 'C-c C-e C-d'
        - roxygen map was moved on 'C-c C-o' and 'ess-roxy-update-entry'
          now resides on 'C-c C-o C-o'
        - ess-handy-commands is not bound anymore
        - 'ess-dev-map' (including 'ess-tracebug' and 'ess-developer')
          moved on 'C-c C-t'
        - 'C-c C-y' is deprecated in favor of 'C-c C-z C-z'
   * ESS[R] new command 'ess-describe-object-at-point' bound to 'C-c C-d
     C-e' (repeat 'C-e' or 'e' to cycle).  It was inspired by Erik
     Iverson's 'ess-R-object-tooltip'.  Customize
     'ess-describe-at-point-method' to use tooltip instead of an
     electric buffer.
   * ESS: New command 'ess-build-tags-for-directory' bound to 'C-c C-e
     C-t' for building dialect specific tag tables.  After building tags
     use 'M-.' to navigate to function and objects definitions.  By
     default 'C-c C-e C-t' builds tags based on imenu regular
     expressions and also include other common languages '.c, .o, .cpp'
     etc.  But it relies on external 'find' and 'etags' commands.  If
     'ess-build-tags-command' is defined (for 'R'), the inferior process
     is asked to build tags instead.
   * ESS: 'ess-switch-process' offers '*new*' alternative to start a new
     process instead of switching to one of the currently running
     processes.
   * ESS: Switching between processes ('C-c C-s') uses buffer names
     instead of the internal process names.  Use 'M-x rename-buffer'
     command to conveniently rename your process buffers.
   * ESS: Process buffers can be automatically named on process creation
     according to user specified scheme.  Default schemes are *proc*,
     *proc:dir* and *proc:abbr-long-dir* where 'proc' stands for the
     internal process name and 'dir' stands for the directory where the
     process was started in.  The default is *proc*.  For customization
     see 'ess-gen-proc-buffer-name-function'.
   * ESS: 'ess-eval-visibly-p' is deprecated in favor of
     'ess-eval-visibly'.
   * ESS: New evaluation pattern 'nowait'.  In addition to old 'nil' and
     't' values, 'ess-eval-visibly' accepts 'nowait' for a visible
     evaluation with no waiting for the process.  See 'ess-eval-visibly'
     for details on evaluation patterns.
   * ESS: New "Process" menu entry with process related commands and
     configuration
   * iESS: Process buffer is now automatically shown on errors
   * ESS: New 'ess-switch-to-inferior-or-script-buffer' command bound to
     'C-c C-z' in both script and process buffers.  If invoked form
     process buffer it switches to the most recent buffer of the same
     dialect.  It is a single key command.
   * ESSR-help: On multiple help pages with the same name, 'C-c C-v' now
     asks for user resolution directly in emacs.
   * ESS[R] ess-roxy: new variable 'ess-roxy-re' for fontification of
     cases where the number of leading '#' differs from 'ess-roxy-str'.
   * ESS[R] Eldoc was considerably enhanced.  It now finds hidden
     default S3 methods and displays non-default methods' arguments
     after trailing ||.
   * ESS[R]: New 'ess-display-demos' command bound to 'C-c C-d o' and
     'C-c C-d C-o'
   * ESS: New 'ess-help-web-search' command bound to 'C-c C-d w' and
     'C-c C-d C-w' to facilitate interactive search of web resources.
     Implemented for 'R', 'Stata' and 'Julia'.  See also
     'ess-help-web-search-command'.
   * ESS: ess-pdf-viewer-pref accepts now command line arguments
   * ESS[Rnw]: Add knitr support.  Customize 'ess-swv-processor' for the
     default processor.
   * ESS[Rnw]: More thorough renaming of remaining 'noweb-*' to
     'ess-noweb-*'.
   * ESS[Rnw] new commands 'ess-eval-chunk-and-step' and
     'ess-eval-chunk' bound to 'M-n C-c' and 'M-n C-M-x' to mirror
     standard ess commands in C-c map.
   * ESS[R] Auto-completion: new variable 'ess-ac-R-argument-suffix' to
     customize the insertion of trailing "=".  Defaults to " = ".
   * ESS[Julia]: Added index, apropos and web-search to julia.
   * ESS help: More evaluation commands were added to ess-help mode
     ('C-c C-c', 'C-M-x' etc)

   Bug Fixes in 12.09-1:
   * iESShelp: Multiple help pages with the same name are properly
     handled on 'C-c C-v'
   * iESSremote: Evaluation with ESS remote no longer freezes emacs.
   * iESS: 'comint-previous-prompt' 'C-c C-p' no longer stops on
     secondary prompt "+".
   * iESS[R], iESS(Sqpe) [S] on Windows: The 'options("editor")' is now
     initialized to 'emacsclient' instead of the previous 'gnuclient'.
     The user may need to add the line '(server-start)' to the emacs
     initialization file.  'emacsclient' has been included with emacs
     since GNU Emacs 22.1.
   * ESS[Rnw] Fixed "connection to R" bug (in 12.09 only).
   * ESS[Rnw] Explicit 'ess-swv-stangle' and 'ess-swv-sweave' functions.
   * ESS[Rnw] Fixed completion and smart underscore problems cause by
     unmatched "\"'
   * ESS[R] is more careful with the 'R' code injection.  It now happens
     only once at the start of the session.
   * ESS[R]: Fixed auto-scrolling the comint buffer on evaluation.
   * ESS[Julia]: Solve several indentation and word navigation problems.
   * ESS[Julia]: Help system works again.

   Changes/New Features in 12.09:

   * Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS requires, ESS support
     of XEmacs ends with ESS 12.04-4.  This decision will be re-visited
     in the future as XEmacs continues to sync with GNU Emacs.

   * ESS[R]: On Windows, there is now a new customizable variable
     (currently called 'ess-directory-containing-R') to tell ESS where
     to look for the 'Rterm.exe' executables.  The name of the variable
     and the values it can take are both in beta and subject to change.
     Prior to this variable, ESS searched only in the default
     installation directory.  Setting this variable now tells ESS how to
     find 'Rterm.exe' executables when they are installed somewhere
     else.

   * ESS[julia]: _new_ mode for editing julia code ('*.jl').  Start with
     'M-x julia'.

     Full interaction interface, imenu and basic error referencing are
     available.

   * ESS[R] noweb: 'noweb-mode' and 'noweb-font-lock-mode' have been
     renamed to 'ess-noweb-mode' and 'ess-noweb-font-lock-mode' to avoid
     conflicts with the "real" 'noweb-mode'.

   * ESS[R] noweb: The long standing font-lock bug has been solved in
     'ess-noweb' interface.

   * ESS: Basic evaluation keys are now bound to 'ess-eval-region-*-'
     functions:

        - 'C-M-x' is bound to 'ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph'
        - 'C-c C-c' is bound to
          'ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph-and-step'
        - 'C-RET' is bound to 'ess-eval-region-or-line-and-step'

     Each of these functions first evaluates the region whenever the
     region is active.

   * ESS: 'C-M-a'/'C-M-e' now step to beginning/end of paragraph if no
     function has been detected.

   * ESS: 'ess-eval-*-and-step' family of functions are now smarter, and
     don't step to end of buffer or end of chunk code ('@') when at the
     end of the code.

   * ESS: 'ess-handy-commands' function is bound to 'C-c h'

   * ESS: ESS is now _blinking_ the evaluated region.  Set
     'ess-blink-region' to nil to deactivate; 'ess-blink-delay' gives
     the duration of the blink.  Evaluated region is "blinked" in
     'highlight' face.

   * ESS[R-help] New key 'a' for "apropos()" in help buffers.  Also
     available through 'C-c h'.

   * ESS[R-help] All R commands of type foo?bar and foo??bar are
     recognized and redirected into appropriate *ESS-help* buffers.

   * ESS[R]: New customization interface for _font-lock_.

     ESS font-lock operates with predefined keywords.  Default keywords
     are listed in 'ess-R-font-lock-keywords' and
     'inferior-R-font-lock-keywords', which see.  The user can easily
     customize those by adding new keywords.  These variables can also
     be interactively accessed and saved through 'ESS/Font-lock'
     submenu.

     Several new fontification keywords have been added.  Most notably
     the keywords for highlighting of function calls, numbers and
     operators.

   * ESS[R]: auto-complete is now activated by default whenever
     auto-complete package is detected.  Set 'ess-use-auto-complete' to
     nil to deactivate.
   * ESS[R]: R AC sources are no longer auto-starting at 0 characters
     but at the default 'ac-auto-start' characters.
   * ESS no longer redefines default ac-sources, but only appends
     'ac-source-filename' to it.
   * ESS: 'ac-source-R' now concatenates " = " to function arguments.

   * ESS: Menus for ESS and iESS have been reorganized and enriched with
     _Tracebug_ and _Developer_ submenus.

   * ESS[R]: 'ess-developer' and 'ess-tracebug' commands are available
     by default in 'ess-dev-map' which is bound to 'C-c d' in ESS and
     iESS maps.

   * ESS[R]: 'eldoc' truncates long lines whenever
     'eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p' is non-nil (the default).  Set
     this variable to t if you insist on multiline eldoc.  See also
     'ess-eldoc-abbreviation-style'.

   * ESS[R]: completion code pre-caches arguments of heavy generics such
     as 'plot' and 'print' to eliminated the undesirable delay on first
     request.

   * iESS: Prompts in inferior buffers are now highlighted uniformly
     with 'comint-highlight-prompt' face.

   * ESS[R]: R process no longer wait for the completion of input in
     inferior buffer.  Thus, long running commands like 'Sys.sleep(5)'
     no longer stall emacs.

   * ESS: [R, S, Stata, Julia] have specialized 'ess-X-post-run-hook's,
     which are run at the end of subprocess initialization.

   * ESS[Stata]: All interactive evaluation commands work as expected.
     On-line comments are removed before the evaluation and multiline
     comments are skipped on 'C-c C-c' and other interactive commands.

   * ESS no longer auto-connects to a subprocess with a different
     dialect than the current buffer's one.

   * ESS: 'ess-arg-function-offset-new-line' is now a list for all the
     ESS indentation styles, which results in the following indentation
     after an open "(":

       a <- some.function(other.function(
          arg1,
          arg2)

   * ESS[SAS]: Improved MS RTF support for GNU Emacs; try
     'ess-sas-rtf-portrait' and 'ess-sas-rtf-landscape'.

   Changes/Bug Fixes in 12.04-3:
   * ESS: basic support for package.el compatibility
   * ESS[R]: correct indentation of & and | continuation lines
   * 'M-x ess-version' shows the svn revision even after 'make install'
   * ESS[SAS]: improved XEmacs support
   * iESS[R]: better finding of previous prompt
   * ESS[Stata]: adjusted prompt for mata mode
   * ESS[R]: resolved name clashes with cl.el
   * ESS[R]: removed dependence on obsolete package assoc
   * New 'make' target 'lisp', to build the lisp-only part, i.e., not
     building the docs.

   Changes/New Features in 12.04-1:
   * iESS[Stata]: New interactive help invocation.
   * iESS[Stata]: New custom variable 'inferior-STA-start-file'.
   * iESS[Stata]: 'inferior-STA-program-name' is now "stata" and can be
     customized.
   * ESS[Stata] New sections in stata help files Syntax('s-S'),
     Remarks('r'), Title('t').

   Bug Fixes in 12.04-1:
   * ESS[R]: Better 'ess-tracebug' error handling.
   * ESS[R]: Corrected 'ess-eldoc' help string filtering and improved
     argument caching.
   * ESS[R]: Indentation of non-block if/else/for/while lines fixed.
   * 'M-x ess-version' should work better.
   * ESS: Filename completion now again works inside strings.
   * iESS[Stata]: Fixed prompt detection issue.
   * ESS[Rd]: R is autostarted also from here, when needed.

   Changes/New Features in 12.04:
   * ESS: Reverting new behavior of 12.03, 'TAB' in 'ess-mode' no longer
     completes by default.  If you want smart 'TAB' completion in R and
     S scripts, similarly to iESS behavior, set the variable
     'ess-tab-complete-in-script' to 't'.  Also see
     'ess-first-tab-never-complete' for how to customize where first
     'TAB' is allowed to complete.
   * ESS: completion is consistently bound to 'M-TAB' (aka 'M-C-i') in
     both Emacs23 and Emacs24.
   * ESS: The variable 'ess-arg-function-offset-new-line' introduced in
     ESS(12.03) now accepts a list with the first element a number to
     indicate that the offset should be computed from the indent of the
     previous line.  For example setting it to '(2) results in:

       a <- some.function(
         arg1,
         arg2)

   Changes/New Features in 12.03:
   * ESS indentation: new offset variable
     'ess-arg-function-offset-new-line' controlling for the indentation
     of lines immediately following open '('.  This is useful to shift
     backwards function arguments after a long function call expression:

       a <- some.function(
              arg1,
              arg2)

     instead of the old

       a <- some.function(
                          arg1,
                          arg2)

     If '(' is not followed by new line the behavior is unchanged:

       a <- some.function(arg1,
                          arg2)

     This variable should be set as part of indentation style lists, or
     in ess-mode hook.
   * ESS[R]: 'C-c .' sets (indentation) style.
   * ESS: In ESS buffers 'yank'('C-y') command accepts double argument
     'C-u C-u' to paste commands only.  It deletes any lines not
     beginning with a prompt, and then removes the prompt from those
     lines that remain.  Useful to paste code from emails,
     documentation, inferior ESS buffers or transcript files.
   * Documentation: ESS user manual has been rearranged and completed
     with several new chapters and sections to reflect newly added
     features ("Completion", "Developing with ESS", "ESS tracebug", "ESS
     developer", "ESS ElDoc", "IDO Completion" and "Evaluating Code")
   * RefCard: Reference card was updated to include new features.
   * Eldoc: Eldoc was rewritten and is activated by default.  See
     'ess-use-eldoc', 'ess-eldoc-show-on-symbol',
     'ess-eldoc-abbreviation-style' variables for how to change the
     default behavior.  _Note:_ 'skeleton-pair-insert-maybe' prohibits
     eldoc display, on '(' insertion.
   * ESS[R]: Eldoc shows arguments of a generic function whenever found.
   * ESS: 'TAB' in 'ess-mode' now indents and completes, if there is
     nothing to indent.  Set 'ess-first-tab-never-completes-p' to 't' to
     make 'TAB' never complete on first invocation.  Completion
     mechanism is similar to the completion in the 'inferior-ess-mode' -
     a filename expansion is tried, if not found ESS completes the
     symbol by querying the process.
   * ESS for emacs version 24 or higher: ESS is fully compatible with
     the emacs 24 completion scheme, i.e.  all the completion is done by
     'completion-at-point'.  Also in accordance with emacs conventions,
     ESS doesn't bind 'M-TAB' for emacs 24 or higher.  'M-TAB' calls the
     default 'complete-symbol'.

   * ESS[R]: Out of the box integration with 'Auto Completion' mode
     http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete
     (http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete) .  Three AC sources
     'ac-source-R-args', 'ac-source-R-objects' and 'ac-source-R' are
     provided.  The last one combines the previous two and makes them
     play nicely together.  Set 'ess-use-auto-complete' to 't' to start
     using it.  Refer to documentation string of 'ac-use-auto-complete'
     for further information.
   * ESS[R]: New unified and fast argument completion system, comprised
     of 'ess-funname.start', 'ess-function-arguments',
     'ess-get-object-at-point'.  Eldoc and auto-completion integration
     are using this system.
   * ESS: 'ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS'('C-c C-z'), and
     'ess-switch-to-ESS'('C-c C-y'): Automatically start the process
     whenever needed.
   * ESS[R]: 'roxy' knows about previewing text version of the
     documentation.  Bound to 'C-c C-e t'.
   * ESS[R]: Solved the "nil filename" bug in roxygen support.
   * ESS[R]: 'ess-tracebug' is now part of ESS:

     New Features:

        - Source injection: Tracebug now can inject source references on
          the fly during code evaluation, i.e.  you don't have to source
          your file, but just evaluate your code in normal fashion.
          Variable 'ess-tracebug-inject-source-p' controls this behavior
          - if t, always inject source reference, if ''function', inject
          only for functions (this is the default), if 'nil', never
          inject.

          During the source injection the value of 'ess-eval-visibly' is
          ignored.
        - Org-mode support: Visual debugger is now aware of the
          temporary org source editing buffer ('C-c '') and jumps
          through this buffers if still alive, or in original org buffer
          otherwise.
        - New keys in watch mode: '?' and 'd'
        - Two new hooks: ess-tracebug-enter-hook and
          ess-tracebug-exit-hook

   * ESS[R]: New package 'ess-developer' to evaluate 'R' code directly
     in the package environment and namespace.  It can be toggled on and
     off with 'C-c d t'.  When 'ess-developer' is on all ESS evaluation
     commands are redefined to evaluate code in appropriate
     environments.  Add package names to the list of your development
     packages with 'C-d a', and remove with 'C-d r'.  Source the current
     file with 'C-d s'.Evaluation function which depend on
     '`ess-eval-region'' ask for the package to source the code into,
     'ess-eval-function' and alternatives search for the function name
     in the development packages' environment and namespace and insert
     the definition accordingly.  See the documentation section
     "Developing with ESS/ESS developer" for more details.

   * ESS[R] help system:

     New Features:

        - 'q' quits window instead of calling
          'ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS'.  This is consistent with emacs
          behavior help and other special buffers (_breaking change_).
        - 'k' kills window without asking for the name (pointed by Sam
          Steingold)
        - Help map inherits from 'special-mode-map' as sugested by Sam
          Steingold.
        - Package index: new function 'ess-display-index' bound to 'i'
          in help mode map.
        - Package vignettes: new function 'ess-display-vignettes' bound
          to 'v' in help mode map.
        - Display help in HTML browser: new function
          'ess-display-help-in-browser' bound to 'w' in help mode map.
          It depends on 'R''s 'browser' option.
        - New custom variable 'ess-help-pop-to-buffer': if non-nil ESS
          help buffers are given focus on display.  The default is 't'
          (_breaking change_).
        - New menu entries for the above functions.
        - Bogus help buffers are no longer generated by default, i.e.
          buffers of the form "No documentation for 'foo' in specified
          packages and libraries: you could try '??foo' ".
          'ess-help-kill-bogus-buffers' now defaults to 't'.  Beware,
          there may be instances where the default is unsatisfactory
          such as debugging and/or during R development.  Thanks to Ross
          Boylan for making the suggestion, Sam Steingold for reminding
          us of this variable and Martin Maechler for the warning.
   * ESS now uses 'IDO' completing read functionality for all the
     interactive requests.  It uses ido completion mechanism whenever
     available, and falls back on classical completing-read otherwise.
     You can set 'ess-use-ido' to nil if you don't want the IDO
     completion.  See the documentation string of 'ess-use-ido' for more
     information about 'IDO' and ESS configuration.

   * ESS[S]: "','" is bound to ess-smart-comma: If comma is invoked at
     the process marker of an ESS inferior buffer, request and execute a
     command from '`ess-handy-commands'' list.  If
     'ess-R-smart-operators' is t '`ess-smart-comma' also inserts " "
     after comma.
   * ESS[S], notably 'R': Variable '`ess-handy-commands'' stores an
     alist of useful commands which are called by 'ess-smart-comma' in
     the inferior buffer.

     Currently containing:

     change-directory
          'ess-change-directory'
     help-index
          'ess-display-index'
     help-object
          'ess-display-help-on-object'
     vignettes
          'ess-display-vignettes'
     objects[ls]
          'ess-execute-objects'
     search
          'ess-execute-search'
     set-width
          'ess-execute-screen-options'
     install.packages
          'ess-install.packages'
     library
          'ess-library'
     setRepos
          'ess-setRepositories'
     sos
          'ess-sos'

     Handy commands: 'ess-library', 'ess-install.packages', etc - ask
     for item with completion and execute the correspond command.
     'ess-sos' is a interface to 'findFn' function in package 'sos'.  If
     package 'sos' is not found, ask user for interactive install.

   * ESS: New dynamic mode line indicator: Process status is
     automatically reflected in all mode-lines of associated with the
     process buffers.  Particularly useful for displaying debug status
     of 'ess-tracebug' and developer status of 'ess-developer' in all
     associated buffers.

   * ESS: New 'ess-completing-read' mechanism: ESS uses 'ido'
     completions whenever possible.  Variable 'ess-use-ido' controls
     whether to use ido completion or not.  Active by default.

   * ESS now supports comint fields for output and input detection.
     This feature is not used by default, but might be useful in the
     future.

   * ESS[S]: New custom variable 'inferior-ess-S-prompt' to customize
     prompt detection regular expression in the inferior ESS buffers.
     You can customize this variable to enhance comint navigation
     ('comint-previous-prompt' and 'comint-next-prompt') the inferior
     buffers.

   * ESS[R]: Internal 'R' completion retrieval
     ('ess-R-complete-object-name') was rewritten and is faster now.

   * ESS is using process plist to store process specific variables, as
     opposed to buffer local variables as it was using before.  The use
     of buffer local variables to store process variables is
     discouraged.

   * ESS: new functions to manipulate process plists: 'ess-process-get'
     and 'ess-process-set'.

   * ESS: Internal process waiting mechanism was completely rewritten.
     ESS no more relies on prompt regular expressions for the prompt
     detection.  The only requirement on the primary process prompt is
     to end in '> '.  This could be overwritten by setting
     'inferor-ess-primary-prompt'.

   * ESS[S], notably 'R': Saved command history: ESS-HISTORY-FILE now
     accepts 't' (default), 'nil', or a file name.  By setting it to
     'nil' no command line history is saved anymore.
     ESS-HISTORY-DIRECTORY now allows to have the history all saved in
     one "central" file.
   * ESS[R]: more Roxygen improvements.
   * ESS[R]: 'C-c .' to set (indentation) style.

   * ESS[R]: Functions with non-standard names (for example
     'aaa-bbb:cc') are properly handled by font-lock and evaluation
     routines.
   * ESS[R]:Several regexp bugs (described in etc/R-ESS-bugs.el) were
     fixed in 'ess-get-words-from-vector' and 'ess-command'.

1.9 Reporting Bugs
==================

Please send bug reports, suggestions etc.  to
<ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch>

   The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

   'M-x ess-submit-bug-report'

   This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

   If Emacs reports an error, backtraces can help us debug the problem.
Type "M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET". Then run the
command that causes the error and you should see a *Backtrace* buffer
containing debug information; send us that buffer.

   Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.
