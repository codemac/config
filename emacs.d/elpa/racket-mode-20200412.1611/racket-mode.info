1 Introduction
**************

The Racket Mode (https://www.racket-mode.com/) package consists of a
variety of Emacs major and minor modes, including:

   • ‘racket-mode’: A major mode for editing ‘.rkt’ files.

   • *note racket-xp-mode::: An optional minor mode that enhances
     ‘racket-mode’ to explain and explore code.

   • ‘racket-repl-mode’: A major mode for running programs providing a
     REPL.

   • Various other modes to support specific features:
        • *note racket-logger-mode::
        • *note racket-profile-mode::
        • *note racket-debug-mode::

   Racket Mode uses a “back end server” written in Racket, which is
responsible for running files and implementing commands that cannot be
implemented in Emacs Lisp.(1)

   For code, issues, and pull requests, see the Git repo
(https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Racket Mode’s Racket code is also delivered as part of the Emacs
package — _not_ as a Racket package.  Delivering both Emacs and Racket
code in one Emacs package simplifies installation and updates.  The main
drawback is that the Racket code is not automatically byte-compiled, as
would normally be done by ‘raco pkg install’.  To address this: *Note
racket-mode-start-faster::.

2 Install
*********

The recommended way to use Racket Mode is to install the package from
MELPA (https://melpa.org/).
* Menu:

* Configure Emacs to use MELPA::
* Install Racket Mode::
* Minimal Racket::
* Uninstall::
* Update::


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Configure Emacs to use MELPA,  Next: Install Racket Mode,  Up: Install

2.1 Configure Emacs to use MELPA
================================

To use MELPA:

   • Add the following to your ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
     	      '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
     	      t)

   • Restart Emacs.

   • Type ‘M-x’ ‘package-refresh-contents’ ‘RET’ .


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Install Racket Mode,  Next: Minimal Racket,  Prev: Configure Emacs to use MELPA,  Up: Install

2.2 Install Racket Mode
=======================

When Emacs is configured to use MELPA, simply type ‘M-x’ package-install
‘RET’ racket-mode ‘RET’ .


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Minimal Racket,  Next: Uninstall,  Prev: Install Racket Mode,  Up: Install

2.3 Minimal Racket
==================

If you have installed the minimal Racket distribution (for example by
using the homebrew formula
(https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/minimal-racket.rb))
Racket Mode needs some additional packages (like ‘errortrace’ and
‘macro-debugger’).  A simple way to get all these packages is to install
the ‘drracket’ Racket package.  In a command shell:

     raco pkg install drracket


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Uninstall,  Next: Update,  Prev: Minimal Racket,  Up: Install

2.4 Uninstall
=============

To uninstall Racket Mode, simply type ‘M-x’ ‘package-delete’ ‘RET’
‘racket-mode’ ‘RET’ .

   You should probably also exit and restart Emacs.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Update,  Prev: Uninstall,  Up: Install

2.5 Update
==========

Be aware that updating an Emacs package doesn’t necessarily fully update
Emacs’ state.  (One example symptom: an “invalid function” error
message.)

   After updating the package, you might need to restart Emacs.

   In some cases, you might even need to:

  1. Uninstall Racket Mode.

  2. Exit and restart Emacs.

  3. Install Racket Mode.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Configure,  Next: Reference,  Prev: Install,  Up: Top

3 Configure
***********

Although Racket Mode can be customized with many *note Variables::,
there is only one that you might _need_ to set: *note racket-program::.
This is the name or pathname of the Racket executable.  It defaults to
‘Racket.exe’ on Windows else ‘racket’.

   On Windows or Linux, this default will probably work for you.

   On macOS, downloading Racket doesn’t add its ‘bin’ directory to your
‘PATH’.  Even after you add it, GUI Emacs doesn’t automatically use your
path (unless you use the handy exec-path-from-shell
(https://melpa.org/#/exec-path-from-shell) package).  Therefore you
might want to set ‘racket-program’ to a full pathname like
‘/usr/racket/bin/racket’.

   You can ‘setq’ this directly in your Emacs init file (~/.emacs or
~/.emacs.d/init.el), or, use ‘M-x’ ‘customize’, as you prefer.

File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Key bindings,  Next: Font-lock (syntax highlighting),  Up: Configure

3.1 Key bindings
================

To customize things like key bindings, you can use ‘racket-mode-hook’ in
your Emacs init file to modify ‘racket-mode-map’.  For example, although
‘C-c C-c’ is bound by default to the ‘racket-run’ command, let’s say you
wanted ‘F5’ to be an additional binding:

     (add-hook 'racket-mode-hook
     	  (lambda ()
     	    (define-key racket-mode-map (kbd "<f5>") 'racket-run)))

   Likewise for ‘racket-repl-mode-hook’ and ‘racket-repl-mode-map’.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Font-lock (syntax highlighting),  Next: Completion,  Prev: Key bindings,  Up: Configure

3.2 Font-lock (syntax highlighting)
===================================

Font-lock (as Emacs calls syntax highlighting) can be controlled using
the variable ‘font-lock-maximum-decoration’, which defaults to ‘t’
(maximum).  You can set it to a number, where ‘0’ is the lowest level.
You can even supply an association list to specify different values for
different major modes.

   Historically you might choose a lower level for speed.  These days
you might do so because you prefer a simpler appearance.

   Racket Mode supports four, increasing levels of font-lock:

   • ‘0’: Just strings, comments, and ‘#lang’.
   • ‘1’: ‘#:keyword’ and self-evaluating literals like numbers, quoted
     symbols (including symbols with spaces delimited by ‘|’
     characters), and ‘#rx’ and ‘#px’ regular expressions.
   • ‘2’: Identifiers in ‘define’-like and ‘let’-like forms.
   • ‘3’: Identifiers provided by ‘racket’, ‘typed/racket’,
     ‘racket/syntax’, and ‘syntax/parse’.  (This level effectively
     treats Racket as a language, instead of a language for making
     languages.).


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Completion,  Next: Indent,  Prev: Font-lock (syntax highlighting),  Up: Configure

3.3 Completion
==============

In Emacs, a major mode may supply a “completion-at-point function”.
This function is used by manual completion commands like
‘complete-symbol’ (bound by default to ‘C-M-i’ ), as well as by
auto-completion packages like ‘company-mode’.

   • ‘racket-mode’ supplies ‘racket-complete-at-point’, which simply
     supplies the same symbols that it knows how to font-lock.  This
     does _not_ require the Racket Mode back end to be running.  But of
     course the completion candidates do not correspond to your
     program’s definitions or those it imports.  This is a static,
     “better than nothing” fallback.

   • ‘racket-xp-mode’ — an optional minor mode that enhances
     ‘racket-mode’ — supplies ‘racket-xp-complete-at-point’, which uses
     a static anaylsis to find local and imported binding names.
     Although this requires the Racket Mode back end to be running — and
     will automatically start it — it does _not_ require the edit buffer
     to be ‘racket-run’.

   • ‘racket-repl-mode’ supplies ‘racket-repl-complete-at-point’, which
     uses the result of ‘namespace-mapped-symbols’ on the program
     currently running in the REPL.

   These completion functions are set by default.  (However,
‘racket-xp-mode’ is not enabled by default.  To do so: *note
racket-xp-mode::.)

   If you want ‘TAB’ to do completion as well as indent, add the
following to your Emacs init file:

     (setq tab-always-indent 'complete)

   This changes the behavior of Emacs’ standard
‘indent-for-tab-command’, to which ‘TAB’ is bound by default in
‘racket-mode’ and ‘racket-repl-mode’.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Indent,  Next: paredit,  Prev: Completion,  Up: Configure

3.4 Indent
==========

Indentation can be customized in a way similar to lisp-mode and
scheme-mode: *note racket-indent-line::.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: paredit,  Next: smartparens,  Prev: Indent,  Up: Configure

3.5 paredit
===========

If you use paredit (https://melpa.org/#/paredit), you might want to add
keybindings to ‘paredit-mode-map’:

   • Bind the curly brace keys to ‘paredit-open-curly’ and
     ‘paredit-close-curly’.

   • Bind whatever keys you prefer for ‘paredit-wrap-square’ and
     ‘paredit-wrap-curly’.

   For example, with ‘use-package’ (https://melpa.org/#/use-package):

     (use-package paredit
       :ensure t
       :config
       (dolist (m '(emacs-lisp-mode-hook
     	       racket-mode-hook
     	       racket-repl-mode-hook))
         (add-hook m #'paredit-mode))
       (bind-keys :map paredit-mode-map
     	     ("{"   . paredit-open-curly)
     	     ("}"   . paredit-close-curly))
       (unless terminal-frame
         (bind-keys :map paredit-mode-map
     	       ("M-[" . paredit-wrap-square)
     	       ("M-{" . paredit-wrap-curly))))


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: smartparens,  Next: Edit buffers and REPL buffers,  Prev: paredit,  Up: Configure

3.6 smartparens
===============

If instead of paredit you prefer smartparens
(https://melpa.org/#/smartparens), you can use the default configuration
it provides for Lisp modes generally and for Racket Mode specifically:

     (require 'smartparens-config)


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Edit buffers and REPL buffers,  Next: eldoc,  Prev: smartparens,  Up: Configure

3.7 Edit buffers and REPL buffers
=================================

By default, all ‘racket-mode’ edit buffers share one ‘racket-repl-mode’
buffer.  For example, if you ‘racket-run’ “foo.rkt”, the REPL prompt
changes to “foo.rkt>”, and the REPL is inside the file module namespace.
If you then ‘racket-run’ “bar.rkt”, the REPL prompt changes to
“bar.rkt>”, and you are in that namespace.

   If you prefer, you can use more than one REPL buffer, by customizing
the variable *note racket-repl-buffer-name-function::: Another option is
to have one REPL buffer for each edit buffer, similar to Dr Racket.  Yet
another option is to have files belong to the same project all share the
same REPL buffer.  You can also define your own, custom function.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: eldoc,  Next: Start faster,  Prev: Edit buffers and REPL buffers,  Up: Configure

3.8 eldoc
=========

By default Racket Mode sets ‘eldoc-documentation-function’ to ‘nil’ — no
‘eldoc-mode’ support.  You may set it to ‘racket-eldoc-function’ in a
‘racket-mode-hook’ and ‘racket-repl-mode-hook’ if you really want to use
‘eldoc-mode’ with Racket.  But it is not a very satisfying experience
because Racket is not a very “eldoc-friendly” language.  Although Racket
Mode attempts to discover argument lists, contracts, or types this
doesn’t work in many common cases:

   • Many Racket primitives are defined in ‘#%kernel’ or ‘#%runtime’.
     There’s no easy way to determine their argument lists.  Most do not
     ‘provide’ a contract.

   • Many of the interesting Racket forms are syntax (macros) not
     functions.  There’s no easy way to determine their “argument
     lists”.

   • When a form has documentation, Racket Mode can show the \"bluebox\”
     – but often that does not fit in a single line as you would
     normally expect with eldoc.

   A more satisfying experience is to use *note racket-xp-describe:: or
*note racket-xp-documentation::.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Start faster,  Next: Unicode input method,  Prev: eldoc,  Up: Configure

3.9 Start faster
================

You can use *note racket-mode-start-faster:: to make the Racket REPL
start faster.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: Unicode input method,  Prev: Start faster,  Up: Configure

3.10 Unicode input method
=========================

An optional Emacs input method, ‘racket-unicode’, lets you easily type
various Unicode symbols that might be useful when writing Racket code.

   To automatically enable the ‘racket-unicode’ input method in
‘racket-mode’ and ‘racket-repl-mode’ buffers, put the following code in
your Emacs init file:

     (add-hook 'racket-mode-hook      #'racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
     (add-hook 'racket-repl-mode-hook #'racket-unicode-input-method-enable)

   *Note racket-unicode-input-method-enable::.

   *Note racket-insert-lambda::.

5.1.4 racket-tidy-requires
--------------------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-tidy-requires’ ‘RET’

   Make a single top-level “require” form, modules sorted, one per line.

   All top-level require forms are combined into a single form.  Within
that form:

   • A single subform is used for each phase level, sorted in this
     order: for-syntax, for-template, for-label, for-meta, and plain
     (phase 0).

        • Within each level subform, the modules are sorted:

             • Collection path modules – sorted alphabetically.

             • Subforms such as only-in.

             • Quoted relative requires – sorted alphabetically.

   At most one module is listed per line.

   Note: This only works for requires at the top level of a source file
using #lang.  It does NOT work for require forms inside module forms.

   See also: *note racket-trim-requires:: and *note
racket-base-requires::.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: racket-trim-requires,  Next: racket-base-requires,  Prev: racket-tidy-requires,  Up: Edit

5.1.5 racket-trim-requires
--------------------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-trim-requires’ ‘RET’

   Like *note racket-tidy-requires:: but also deletes unnecessary
requires.

   Note: This only works when the source file can be fully expanded with
no errors.

   Note: This only works for requires at the top level of a source file
using #lang.  It does NOT work for require forms inside module forms.
Furthermore, it is not smart about module+ or module* forms – it might
delete top level requires that are actually needed by such submodules.

   See also: *note racket-base-requires::.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: racket-base-requires,  Next: racket-indent-line,  Prev: racket-trim-requires,  Up: Edit

5.1.6 racket-base-requires
--------------------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-base-requires’ ‘RET’

   Change from “#lang racket” to “#lang racket/base”.

   Adds explicit requires for imports that are provided by “racket” but
not by “racket/base”.

   This is a recommended optimization for Racket applications.  Avoiding
loading all of “racket” can reduce load time and memory footprint.

   Also, as does *note racket-trim-requires::, this removes unneeded
modules and tidies everything into a single, sorted require form.

   Note: This only works when the source file can be fully expanded with
no errors.

   Note: This only works for requires at the top level of a source file
using #lang.  It does NOT work for require forms inside module forms.
Furthermore, it is not smart about module+ or module* forms – it might
delete top level requires that are actually needed by such submodules.

   Note: Currently this only helps change “#lang racket” to “#lang
racket/base”.  It does not help with other similar conversions, such as
changing “#lang typed/racket” to “#lang typed/racket/base”.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: racket-indent-line,  Next: racket-smart-open-bracket-mode,  Prev: racket-base-requires,  Up: Edit

5.1.7 racket-indent-line
------------------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-indent-line’ ‘RET’

   Indent current line as Racket code.

   Normally you don’t need to use this command directly, it is used
automatically when you press keys like RET or TAB. However you might
refer to it when configuring custom indentation, explained below.

   This behaves like ‘lisp-indent-line’, except that whole-line comments
are treated the same regardless of whether they start with single or
double semicolons.

   • Automatically indents forms that start with “begin” in the usual
     way that “begin” is indented.

   • Automatically indents forms that start with “def” or “with-” in the
     usual way that “define” is indented.

   • Has rules for many specific standard Racket forms.

   To extend, use your Emacs init file to

     (put SYMBOL 'racket-indent-function INDENT)

   SYMBOL is the name of the Racket form like “’test-case” and INDENT is
an integer or the symbol “’defun”.  When INDENT is an integer, the
meaning is the same as for lisp-indent-function and
scheme-indent-function: Indent the first INDENT arguments specially and
indent any further arguments like a body.

   For example:

     (put 'test-case 'racket-indent-function 1)

   This will change the indent of ‘test-case’ from this:

     (test-case foo
     	   blah
     	   blah)

   to this:

     (test-case foo
       blah
       blah)

   If ‘racket-indent-function’ has no property for a symbol,
scheme-indent-function is also considered, although the “with-” indents
defined by scheme-mode are ignored.  This is only to help people who may
have extensive scheme-indent-function settings, particularly in the form
of file or dir local variables.  Otherwise prefer putting properties on
‘racket-indent-function’.

5.1.8 racket-smart-open-bracket-mode
------------------------------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-smart-open-bracket-mode’ ‘RET’

   Minor mode to let you always type ‘[’’ to insert ‘(’ or ‘[’
automatically.

   Behaves like the “Automatically adjust opening square brackets”
feature in Dr.  Racket.

   By default, inserts a ‘(’.  Inserts a ‘[’ in the following cases:

   • ‘let’-like bindings – forms with ‘let’ in the name as well as
     things like ‘parameterize’, ‘with-handlers’, and ‘with-syntax’.

   • ‘case’, ‘cond’, ‘match’, ‘syntax-case’, ‘syntax-parse’, and
     ‘syntax-rules’ clauses.

   • ‘for’-like bindings and ‘for/fold’ accumulators.

   • ‘class’ declaration syntax, such as ‘init’ and ‘inherit’.

   When the previous s-expression in a sequence is a compound
expression, uses the same kind of delimiter.

   To force insert ‘[’, use ‘quoted-insert’.

   Combined with *note racket-insert-closing:: this means that you can
press the unshifted ‘[’ and ‘]’ keys to get whatever delimiters follow
the Racket conventions for these forms.  When something like
‘electric-pair-mode’ or ‘paredit-mode’ is active, you need not even
press ‘]’.

   Tip: When also using ‘paredit-mode’, enable that first so that the
binding for the ‘[’’ key in the map for *note
racket-smart-open-bracket-mode:: has higher priority.  See also the
variable ‘minor-mode-map-alist’.

‘]’ or ‘)’

   Insert a matching closing delimiter.

   With a prefix, insert the typed character as-is.

   This is handy if you’re not yet using something like ‘paredit-mode’,
‘smartparens-mode’, ‘parinfer-mode’, or simply ‘electric-pair-mode’
added in Emacs 24.5.

5.1.11 racket-backward-up-list
------------------------------

‘C-M-u’

   Like ‘backward-up-list’ but works when point is in a string or
comment.

   Typically you should not use this command in Emacs Lisp – especially
not repeatedly.  Instead, initially use
‘racket--escape-string-or-comment’ to move to the start of a string or
comment, if any, then use normal ‘backward-up-list’ repeatedly.

5.1.12 racket-unicode-input-method-enable
-----------------------------------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-unicode-input-method-enable’ ‘RET’

   Set input method to racket-unicode.

   The racket-unicode input method lets you easily type various Unicode
symbols that might be useful when writing Racket code.

   To automatically enable the racket-unicode input method in
racket-mode and racket-repl-mode buffers, put the following code in your
Emacs init file:

     (add-hook 'racket-mode-hook #'racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
     (add-hook 'racket-repl-mode-hook #'racket-unicode-input-method-enable)

   To temporarily enable this input method for a single buffer you can
use “M-x racket-unicode-input-method-enable”.

   Use the standard Emacs key C-\ to toggle the input method.

   When the racket-unicode input method is active, you can for example
type “All” and it is immediately replaced with “∀”.  A few other
examples:

omega       ω
x_1         x₁
x^1         x¹
A           𝔸
test–>>E    test–>>∃ (racket/redex)
vdash       ⊢

   To see a table of all key sequences use “M-x describe-input-method
<RET> racket-unicode”.

   If you want to add your own mappings to the “racket-unicode” input
method, you may add code like the following example in your Emacs init
file:

     ;; Either (require 'racket-mode) here, or, if you use
     ;; use-package, put the code below in the :config section.
     (with-temp-buffer
       (racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
       (set-input-method "racket-unicode")
       (let ((quail-current-package (assoc "racket-unicode"
     				      quail-package-alist)))
         (quail-define-rules ((append . t))
     			("^o" ["ᵒ"]))))

   If you don’t like the highlighting of partially matching tokens you
can turn it off by setting ‘input-method-highlight-flag’ to nil.

5.1.13 racket-align
-------------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-align’ ‘RET’

   Align values in the same column.

   Useful for binding forms like “let” and “parameterize”, conditionals
like “cond” and “match”, association lists, and any series of couples
like the arguments to “hash”.

   Before choosing this command, put point on the first of a series of
“couples”.  A couple is:

   • A list of two or more sexprs: "[sexpr val sexpr ...]".
   • Two sexprs: “sexpr val”.

   Each “val” moves to the same column and is ‘prog-indent-sexp’-ed (in
case it is a multi-line form).

   For example with point on the "[" before “a”:

     Before             After

     (let ([a 12]       (let ([a   12]
           [bar 23])          [bar 23])
       ....)              ....)

     '([a . 12]         '([a   . 12]
       [bar . 23])        [bar . 23])

     (cond [a? #t]      (cond [a?   #t]
           [b? (f x           [b?   (f x
     	     y)]                  y)]
           [else #f])         [else #f])

   Or with point on the quote before “a”:

     (list 'a 12        (list 'a   12
           'bar 23)           'bar 23)

   If more than one couple is on the same line, none are aligned,
because it is unclear where the value column should be.  For example the
following form will not change; *note racket-align:: will display an
error message:

     (let ([a 0][b 1]
           [c 2])       error; unchanged
       ....)

   When a couple’s sexprs start on different lines, that couple is
ignored.  Other, single-line couples in the series are aligned as usual.
For example:

     (let ([foo         (let ([foo
            0]                 0]
           [bar 1]            [bar 1]
           [x 2])             [x   2])
       ....)              ....)

5.2.1 racket-xp-mode
--------------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-xp-mode’ ‘RET’

   A minor mode that analyzes expanded code to explain and explore.

   This minor mode is an optional enhancement to ‘racket-mode’ edit
buffers.  Like any minor mode, you can turn it on or off for a specific
buffer.  If you always want to use it, put the following code in your
Emacs init file:

     (require 'racket-xp)
     (add-hook 'racket-mode-hook #'racket-xp-mode)

   Note: This mode won’t do anything unless/until the Racket Mode back
end is running.  It will try to start the back end automatically.  You
do _not_ need to *note racket-run:: the buffer you are editing.

   This mode uses the drracket/check-syntax package to analyze
fully-expanded programs, without needing to evaluate a.k.a.  “run” them.
The resulting analysis provides information for:

   • Visually annotating bindings – local or imported definitions and
     references to them.

   • Completion candidates.

   • Defintions’ source and documentation.

   When point is on a definition or use, related items are highlighted
using *note racket-xp-def-face:: and *note racket-xp-use-face:: –
instead of drawing arrows as in Dr Racket.  Information is displayed
using the function(s) in the hook variable *note
racket-show-functions::; it is also available when hovering the mouse
cursor.  Note: If you find these features too distracting and/or slow,
you may disable ‘cursor-sensor-mode’.  The remaining features discussed
below will still work.

   You may also use commands to navigate among a definition and its
uses, or to rename a local definitions and all its uses.

   In the following little example, not only does drracket/check-syntax
distinguish the various “x” bindings, it understands the two different
imports of “define”:

     #lang racket/base
     (define x 1)
     x
     (let ([x x])
       (+ x 1))
     (module m typed/racket/base
       (define x 2)
       x)

   The function ‘racket-xp-complete-at-point’ is added to the variable
‘completion-at-point-functions’.  Note that in this case, it is not
smart about submodules; identifiers are assumed to be definitions from
the file’s module or its imports.  In addition to supplying completion
candidates, it supports the “:company-location” property to inspect the
definition of a candidate and the “:company-doc-buffer” property to view
its documentation.

   When you edit the buffer, existing annotations are retained; their
positions are updated to reflect the edit.  Annotations for new or
deleted text are not requested until after *note
racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay:: seconds.  The request is made
asynchronously so that Emacs will not block – for moderately complex
source files, it can take some seconds simply to fully expand them, as
well as a little more time for the drracket/check-syntax analysis.  When
the results are ready, all annotations for the buffer are completely
refreshed.

   You may also set *note racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay:: to nil
and use the ‘racket-xp-annotate’ command manually.

   The mode line changes to reflect the current status of annotations,
and whether or not you had a syntax error.

   If you have one or more syntax errors, ‘racket-xp-next-error’ and
‘racket-xp-previous-error’ to navigate among them.  Although most
languages will stop after the first syntax error, some like Typed Racket
will try to collect and report multiple errors.

   Tip: This mode follows the convention that a minor mode may only use
a prefix key consisting of “C-c” followed by a punctuation key.  As a
result, ‘racket-xp-control-c-hash-keymap’ is bound to “C-c #” by
default.  Although you might find this awkward to type, remember that as
an Emacs user, you are free to bind this map to a more convenient
prefix, and/or bind any individual commands directly to whatever keys
you prefer.

   The intent is to give a quick reminder or introduction to something,

within Emacs, without switching to a web browser.

   This buffer is also displayed when you use ‘company-mode’ and press
F1 or C-h in its pop up completion list.

   • If the identifier has installed Racket documentation, then a
     simplified version of the HTML is presented in the buffer,
     including the “blue box”, documentation prose, and examples.

   • Otherwise, if the identifier is a function, then its signature is
     displayed, for example "(name arg-1-name arg-2-name)".

   You can quit the buffer by pressing q.  Also, at the bottom of the

----------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-run’ ‘RET’

   Save the buffer in REPL and run your program.

   Runs the “main” submodule, if any, otherwise the file’s module.  See
also *note racket-run-module-at-point::.

   With one C-u prefix, uses errortrace for improved stack traces.
Otherwise follows the *note racket-error-context:: setting.

   With two C-u prefixes, instruments code for step debugging.  See
*note racket-debug-mode:: and the variable *note
racket-debuggable-files::.

   Each run occurs within a Racket custodian.  Any prior run’s custodian
is shut down, releasing resources like threads and ports.  Each run’s
evaluation environment is reset to the contents of the source file.  In
other words, like Dr Racket, this provides the benefit that your source
file is the “single source of truth”.  At the same time, the run gives
you a REPL inside the namespace of the module, giving you the ability to
explore it interactively.  Any explorations are temporary, unless you
also make them to your source file, they will be lost on the next run.

   See also *note racket-run-and-switch-to-repl::, which is even more
like Dr Racket’s Run command because it selects the REPL window after
running.

   In the ‘racket-repl-mode’ buffer, output that describes a file and
position is automatically “linkified”.  Examples of such text include:

   • Racket error messages.
   • rackunit test failure location messages.
   • print representation of path objects.

   To visit these locations, move point there and press RET or mouse
click.  Or, use the standard ‘next-error’ and ‘previous-error’ commands.

‘C-c C-z’

   Show a Racket REPL buffer in some window.

   *IMPORTANT*

   The main, intended use of Racket Mode’s REPL is that you ‘find-file’
some specific .rkt file, then *note racket-run:: it.  The REPL will then
match that file.

   If the REPL isn’t running, and you want to start it for no file in
particular?  Then you could use this command.  But the resulting REPL
will have a minimal “#lang racket/base” namespace.  You could enter
"(require racket)" if you want the equivalent of “#lang racket”.  You
could also "(require racket/enter)" if you want things like “enter!”.
But in some sense you’d be “using it wrong”.  If you really don’t want
to use Racket Mode’s REPL as intended, then you might as well use a
plain Emacs shell buffer to run command-line Racket.

   Otherwise, opens the ‘search for a term’ page, where you can choose
among multiple possibilities.  (i.e.  Uses the string variant of
racket/help.)

   With a C-u prefix, prompts for the identifier or quoted string,

5.3.13 racket-debug-mode
------------------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-debug-mode’ ‘RET’

   Minor mode for debug breaks.

   This feature is **EXPERIMENTAL**!!! It is likely to have significant
limitations and bugs.  You are welcome to open an issue to provide
feedback.  Please understand that this feature might never be improved –
it might even be removed someday if it turns out to have too little
value and/or too much cost.

   How to debug:

  1. “Instrument” code for step debugging.  You can instrument entire
     files, and also individual functions.

     a.  Entire Files

     Choose *note racket-run:: with two prefixes – C-u C-u C-c C-c.  The
     file will be instrumented for step debugging before it is run.
     Also instrumented are files determined by the variable *note
     racket-debuggable-files::.

     The run will break at the first breakable position.

     Tip: After you run to completion and return to a normal REPL
     prompt, the code remains instrumented.  You may enter expressions
     that evaluate instrumented code and it will break so you can step
     debug again.

     b.  Function Definitions

     Put point in a function ‘define’ form and C-u C-M-x to “instrument”
     the function for step debugging.  Then in the REPL, enter an
     expression that causes the instrumented function to be run,
     directly or indirectly.

     You can instrument any number of functions.

     You can even instrument while stopped at a break.  For example, to
     instrument a function you are about to call, so you can “step into”
     it:

        • M-.  a.k.a.  ‘racket-visit-definition’.
        • C-u C-M-x to instrument the definition.
        • M-, a.k.a.  *note racket-unvisit::.
        • Continue stepping.
     Limitation: Instrumenting a function ~require~d from another module
     won’t redefine that function.  Instead, it attempts to define an
     instrumented function of the same name, in the module the REPL is
     inside.  The define will fail if it needs definitions visible only
     in that other module.  In that case you’ll probably need to use
     entire-file instrumentation as described above.

  2. When a break occurs, the ‘racket-repl-mode’ prompt changes.  In
     this debug REPL, local variables are available for you to use and
     even to ‘set!’.

     Also, in the ‘racket-mode’ buffer where the break is located, *note
     racket-debug-mode:: is enabled.  This minor mode makes the buffer
     read-only, provides visual feedback – about the break position,
     local variable values, and result values – and provides shortcut
     keys:

   Takes a collection name from point (or, with a prefix, prompts you).

   If only one directory is found, ‘ido-find-file-in-dir’ lets you pick
a file there.

   If more than one directory is found, ‘ido-completing-read’ lets you
pick one, then ‘ido-find-file-in-dir’ lets you pick a file there.

   Note: This requires the ‘raco-find-collection’ package to be

5.8.2 racket-mode-start-faster
------------------------------

‘M-x’ ‘racket-mode-start-faster’ ‘RET’

   Compile Racket Mode’s .rkt files for faster startup.

   Racket Mode is implemented as an Emacs Lisp “front end” that talks to
a Racket process “back end”.  Because Racket Mode is delivered as an
Emacs package instead of a Racket package, installing it does not do the
‘raco setup’ that is normally done for Racket packages.

   This command will do a ‘raco make’ of Racket Mode’s .rkt files,
creating bytecode files in ‘compiled/’ subdirectories.  As a result,
when a *note racket-run:: or *note racket-repl:: command must start the
Racket process, it will start faster.

   If you run this command, ever, you should run it again after:

   • Installing an updated version of Racket Mode.  Otherwise, you might
     lose some of the speed-up.

   • Installing a new version of Racket and/or changing the value of the
     variable *note racket-program::.  Otherwise, you might get an error
     message due to the bytecode being different versions.

How many seconds to wait for command server responses.

-------------------------

Terminate the Racket process if memory use exceeds this value in MB.

   Changes to this value take effect upon the next *note racket-run::.
A value of 0 means no limit.

   Caveat: This uses Racket’s ‘custodian-limit-memory’, which does not
enforce the limit exactly.  Instead, the program will be terminated upon
the first garbage collection where memory exceeds the limit (maybe by a
significant amount).

6.1.5 racket-error-context
--------------------------

The level of context used for *note racket-run:: error stack traces.

   Each level improves stack trace information, but causes your program
to run more slowly.

   • ‘low corresponds to ‘compile-context-preservation-enabled’ ‘#f’.

   • ‘medium corresponds to ‘compile-context-preservation-enabled’ ‘#t’,
     which disables some optimizations like inlining.

   • ‘high corresponds to ‘compile-context-preservation-enabled’ ‘#t’
     and to use of ‘errortrace’, which heavily instruments your code and
     therefore may be significantly slower.

   Tip: Regardless of this setting, you can enable ‘high errortrace for
a specific *note racket-run:: using a C-u prefix.  This lets you
normally run with a faster setting, and temporarily re-run to get a
more-helpful error message.

List of command-line arguments to supply to your Racket program.

‘current-command-line-arguments’ and friends.

   This is an Emacs buffer-local variable — convenient to set as a file
local variable.  For example at the end of your .rkt file:

     ;; Local Variables:
     ;; racket-user-command-line-arguments: ("-f" "bar")
     ;; End:

   Set this way, the value must be an *unquoted* list of strings.  For
example:

     ("-f" "bar")

   The following values will _not_ work:

     '("-f" "bar")

6.1.7 racket-path-from-emacs-to-racket-function
-----------------------------------------------

A function used to transform Emacs Lisp pathnames before supplying to
the Racket back end.

   If you run Emacs on Windows Subsystem for Linux, and want to run
Racket programs using Windows Racket.exe rather than Linux racket, you
can set this to ‘racket-wsl-to-windows’.  In that case you probably also
want to customize the “reverse”: *note

6.1.8 racket-path-from-racket-to-emacs-function
-----------------------------------------------

A function used to transform pathnames supplied by the Racket back end
before using them in Emacs.

   The default on Windows replaces back with forward slashes.  The
default elsewhere is ‘identity’.

   If you run Emacs on Windows Subsystem for Linux, and want to run
Racket programs using Windows Racket.exe rather than Linux racket, you
can set this to ‘racket-windows-to-wsl’.  In that case you probably also
want to customize the “reverse”: *note

   Set to nil to disable automatic refresh and manually use
‘racket-xp-annotate’.

6.1.10 racket-xp-highlight-unused-regexp

this regexp.

   The default is to highlight identifiers that do not start with an
underline, which is a common convention.

6.2.1 racket-repl-buffer-name-function
--------------------------------------

How to associate ‘racket-mode’ edit buffers with ‘racket-repl-mode’
buffers.

   The default is nil, which is equivalent to supplying *note
racket-repl-buffer-name-shared::: One REPL buffer is shared.

   Other predefined choices include *note
racket-repl-buffer-name-unique:: and *note
racket-repl-buffer-name-project::.

   This is used when a ‘racket-mode’ buffer is created.  Changing this
to a new value only affects ‘racket-mode’ buffers created later.

   Any such function takes no arguments, should look at
‘buffer-file-name’ if necessary, and either ‘setq-default’ or
‘setq-local’ the variable ‘racket-repl-buffer-name’ to a desired
‘racket-repl-mode’ buffer name.  As a result, *note racket-run::
commands will use a buffer of that name, creating it if necessary.

Which system image viewer program to invoke upon M-x
‘racket-view-last-image’.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: racket-pretty-print,  Prev: racket-images-system-viewer,  Up: REPL variables

File: racket-mode.info,  Node: racket-indent-curly-as-sequence,  Next: racket-indent-sequence-depth,  Up: Other variables

6.3.1 racket-indent-curly-as-sequence
-------------------------------------

Indent ‘{}’ with items aligned with the head item?

   This is indirectly disabled if *note racket-indent-sequence-depth::
is 0.  This is safe to set as a file-local variable.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: racket-indent-sequence-depth,  Next: racket-pretty-lambda,  Prev: racket-indent-curly-as-sequence,  Up: Other variables

6.3.2 racket-indent-sequence-depth
----------------------------------

To what depth should *note racket-indent-line:: search.

   This affects the indentation of forms like ’() ‘() #() – and {} if
*note racket-indent-curly-as-sequence:: is t — but not #’() #‘() ,()
,@().  A zero value disables, giving the normal indent behavior of
DrRacket or Emacs ‘lisp-mode’ derived modes like ‘scheme-mode’.  Setting
this to a high value can make indentation noticeably slower.  This is
safe to set as a file-local variable.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: racket-pretty-lambda,  Next: racket-smart-open-bracket-enable,  Prev: racket-indent-sequence-depth,  Up: Other variables

6.3.3 racket-pretty-lambda
--------------------------

Display lambda keywords using λ.  This is DEPRECATED.

   Instead use ‘prettify-symbols-mode’ in newer verisons of Emacs, or,
use *note racket-insert-lambda:: to insert actual λ characters.

6.3.4 racket-smart-open-bracket-enable
--------------------------------------

This variable is obsolete and has no effect.

   Instead of using this variable, you may bind the ‘[’ key to the
‘racket-smart-open-bracket’ command in the ‘racket-mode-map’ and/or
‘racket-repl-mode-map’ keymaps.


File: racket-mode.info,  Node: racket-logger-config,  Prev: racket-smart-open-bracket-enable,  Up: Other variables

6.3.5 racket-logger-config
--------------------------

Configuration of *note racket-logger-mode:: topics and levels

   The topic ‘* respresents the default level used for topics not
assigned a level.  Otherwise, the topic symbols are the same as used by
Racket’s ‘define-logger’.

   The levels are those used by Racket’s logging system: ‘debug, ‘info,
‘warning, ‘error, ‘fatal.

   For more information see:
<https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/logging.html>

   The default value sets some known “noisy” topics to be one level
quieter.  That way you can set the ‘* topic to a level like ‘debug and
not get overhwelmed by these noisy topics.

6.4.1 racket-debuggable-files
-----------------------------

Used to tell *note racket-run:: what files may be instrumented for
debugging.  Must be a list of strings that are pathnames, such as from
‘racket--buffer-file-name’, -or-, a function that returns such a list
given the pathname of the file being run.  If any path strings are
relative, they are made absolute using ‘expand-file-name’ with the
directory of the file being run.  The symbol ‘run-file may be supplied
in the list; it will be replaced with the pathname of the file being
run.  Safe to set as a file-local variable.

=======================

* Menu:

File: racket-mode.info,  Node: racket-show-functions,  Up: Showing informationx

6.5.1 racket-show-functions
---------------------------

A special hook variable to customize ‘racket-show’.

   Example functions include

   • *note racket-show-echo-area::
   • *note racket-show-pos-tip::
   • *note racket-show-header-line::

   Each function should accept two arguments: VAL and POS.

   VAL is:

   • Non-blank string: Display the string somehow.

   • Blank string: Hide any previously displayed string.

   • nil: Hide any persistent UI that might have been created to show
     strings, such as by *note racket-show-header-line::.

   POS is the buffer position for which to show the message, nil meaning
use some default position.
