This is inst_svn.info, produced by makeinfo version 5.2 from
inst_svn.texi.

The latest development version of ESS is available via
<https://svn.R-project.org/ESS/>, the ESS Subversion repository.  If you
have a Subversion client (see <http://subversion.tigris.org/>), you can
download the sources using:
     % svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk PATH
which will put the ESS files into directory PATH.  Later, within that
directory, 'svn update' will bring that directory up to date.
Windows-based tools such as TortoiseSVN are also available for
downloading the files.  Alternatively, you can browse the sources with a
web browser at: ESS SVN site (https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk).
However, please use a subversion client instead to minimize the load
when retrieving.

   If you remove other versions of ESS from your emacs load-path, you
can then use the development version by adding the following to .emacs:

     (load "/path/to/ess-svn/lisp/ess-site.el")
