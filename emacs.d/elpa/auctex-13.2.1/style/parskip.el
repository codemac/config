;;; Commentary:

;; This file adds support for `parskip.sty' (v2.0h) from 2021/03/14.
;; `parskip.sty' is part of TeXLive.  Note that the parskip package
;; doesn't offer any document user commands and just needs loading
;; with \usepackage.  Hence this style provides only one function for
;; key=val query of package options.

;;; Code:

(require 'tex)
(require 'latex)

(defun LaTeX-parskip-package-options-list ()
  "Return an alist of package options for the parskip package."
  (let ((len (mapcar (lambda (x)
                       (concat TeX-esc (car x)))
                     (LaTeX-length-list))))
    `(("skip"    ,len)
      ("tocskip" ,len)
      ("indent"  ,len)
      ("parfill" ,len))))

(defun LaTeX-parskip-package-options ()
  "Prompt for package options for the parskip package."
  (TeX-read-key-val t (LaTeX-parskip-package-options-list)))
