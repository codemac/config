This is an explanation of how to make a release for Emms. Emms is
currently distributed in three different ways: via the Git repo on
Savannah, as a tarball from GNU, and via GNU ELPA.

* Increase the version number in emms.el (variable, elpa header), Makefile

* Update NEWS

* Push version updates to git repo

* Tag release in VCS, for example `git tag -a 4.2 -m "4.2"'

* Push tag to VCS if needed, for example `git push --tags origin "4.2"'

* Run make release

* Run make upload

* Update copy of emms.info in root directory

* Update online manual (cvs commit -m "update manual" manual/index.html)

* Update website (cvs commit -m "update website" index.html)

* Push to GNU ELPA:

      - merge master into the Savannah "elpa" branch and push to Savannah

      - from the "elpa" branch in Savannah push to elpa.git: "git push elpa elpa:externals/emms"

* Send announcement email to the emms mailing list
