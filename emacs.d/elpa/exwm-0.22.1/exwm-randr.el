;;; Commentary:

;; This module adds RandR support for EXWM.  Currently it requires external
;; tools such as xrandr(1) to properly configure RandR first.  This
;; dependency may be removed in the future, but more work is needed before
;; that.

;; To use this module, load, enable it and configure
;; `exwm-randr-workspace-monitor-plist' and `exwm-randr-screen-change-hook'
;; as follows:
;;
;;   (require 'exwm-randr)
;;   (setq exwm-randr-workspace-monitor-plist '(0 "VGA1"))
;;   (add-hook 'exwm-randr-screen-change-hook
;;             (lambda ()
;;               (start-process-shell-command
;;                "xrandr" nil "xrandr --output VGA1 --left-of LVDS1 --auto")))
;;   (exwm-randr-enable)
;;
;; With above lines, workspace 0 should be assigned to the output named "VGA1",
;; staying at the left of other workspaces on the output "LVDS1".  Please refer
;; to xrandr(1) for the configuration of RandR.

(require 'exwm-workspace)

(defgroup exwm-randr nil
  "RandR."
  :version "25.3"
  :group 'exwm)

(defcustom exwm-randr-refresh-hook nil
  "Normal hook run when the RandR module just refreshed."
  :type 'hook)

(defcustom exwm-randr-screen-change-hook nil
  "Normal hook run when screen changes."
  :type 'hook)

(defcustom exwm-randr-workspace-monitor-plist nil
  "Plist mapping workspaces to monitors.

In RandR 1.5 a monitor is a rectangle region decoupled from the physical
size of screens, and can be identified with `xrandr --listmonitors' (name of
the primary monitor is prefixed with an `*').  When no monitor is created it
automatically fallback to RandR 1.2 output which represents the physical
screen size.  RandR 1.5 monitors can be created with `xrandr --setmonitor'.
For example, to split an output (`LVDS-1') of size 1280x800 into two
side-by-side monitors one could invoke (the digits after `/' are size in mm)

    xrandr --setmonitor *LVDS-1-L 640/135x800/163+0+0 LVDS-1
    xrandr --setmonitor LVDS-1-R 640/135x800/163+640+0 none

If a monitor is not active, the workspaces mapped to it are displayed on the
primary monitor until it becomes active (if ever).  Unspecified workspaces
are all mapped to the primary monitor.  For example, with the following
setting workspace other than 1 and 3 would always be displayed on the
primary monitor where workspace 1 and 3 would be displayed on their
corresponding monitors whenever the monitors are active.

  \\='(1 \"HDMI-1\" 3 \"DP-1\")"
