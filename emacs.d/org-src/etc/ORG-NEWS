** New package and Babel langage

*** =org-eshell.el= by Konrad Hinsen is now in Org

    =org-eshell.el= allows you to create links from [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eshell/index.html][Eshell]].

*** Support for execution of Scala code blocks (see ob-scala.el)
*** Support for execution of IO code blocks (see ob-io.el)

** Incompatible changes

   - If your code relies on =org-write-agenda=, please use
     [[doc::org-agenda-write][org-agenda-write]] from now on.

   - If your code relies on =org-make-link=, please use =concat=
     instead.

** New features and user-visible changes

*** Org Element

    =org-element.el= is a toolbox for parsing and analysing "elements"
    in an Org-mode buffer.  This has been written by Nicolas Goaziou
    and has been tested for quite some time.  It is now part of Org's
    core and many core functions rely on this package.

    Two functions might be particularily handy for users:
    =org-element-at-point= and =org-element-context=.

    See the docstrings for more details.

    Below is a list of editing and navigating commands that now rely
    on =org-element.el=.

**** [[doc::org-fill-paragraph][org-fill-paragraph]] has been completely rewritten

     The filling mechanisms now rely on org-element, trying to do the
     right thing on each element in various contexts.  E.g. filling in
     a list item will preserve indentation; filling in message-mode
     will fall back on the relevant filling functions; etc.

**** [[doc::org-metaup][org-metaup]] and [[doc::org-metadown][org-metadown]] will drag the element backward/forward

     If you want to get the old behavior (i.e. moving a line up and
     down), you can first select the line as an active region, then
     =org-metaup= or =org-metadown= to move the region backward or
     forward.  This also works with regions bigger than just one line.

**** [[doc::org-up-element][org-up-element]] and [[doc::org-down-element][org-down-element]] (respectively =C-c C-^= and =C-c C-_=)

     This will move the point up/down in the hierarchy of elements.

**** [[doc::org-backward-element][org-backward-element]] and [[doc::org-forward-element][org-forward-element]] (respectively =M-{= and =M-}=)

     This will move the point backward/forward in the hierarchy of
     elements.

**** [[doc::org-narrow-to-element][org-narrow-to-element]] will narrow to the element at point
**** [[doc::org-mark-element][org-mark-element]] will mark the element at point

     This command is bound to =M-h= and will mark the element at
     point.  If the point is at a paragraph, it will mark the
     paragraph.  If the point is at a list item, it will mark the list
     item.  Etc.

     Note that if point is at the beginning of a list, it will mark
     the whole list.

     To mark a subtree, you can either use =M-h= on the headline
     (since there is no ambiguity about the element you're at) or
     [[doc::org-mark-subtree][org-mark-subtree]] (=C-c @=) anywhere in the subtree.

     Invoking [[doc::org-mark-element][org-mark-element]] repeatedly will try to mark the next
     element on top of the previous one(s).  E.g. hitting =M-h= twice
     on a headline will mark the current subtree and the next one on
     the same level.

*** Org Agenda

**** New option [[doc::org-agenda-sticky][org-agenda-sticky]]

     There is a new option =org-agenda-sticky= which enables "sticky"
     agendas.  Sticky agendas remain opened in the background so that
     you don't need to regenerate them each time you hit the
     corresponding keystroke.  This is a big time saver.

     When [[doc::org-agenda-sticky][org-agenda-sticky]] is =non-nil=, the agenda buffer will be
     named using the agenda key and its description.  In sticky
     agendas, the =q= key will just bury the agenda buffers and
     further agenda commands will show existing buffer instead of
     generating new ones.

     If [[doc::org-agenda-sticky][org-agenda-sticky]] is set to =nil=, =q= will kill the single
     agenda buffer.

**** New option [[doc::org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts][org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts]]

     Setting this option allows you to define specific context where
     agenda commands should be available from.  For example, when set
     to this value

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
        '(("p" (in-file . "\\.txt"))))
#+END_SRC

     then the =p= agenda command will only be available from buffers
     visiting *.txt files.  See the docstring and the manual for more
     details on how to use this.

**** Changes in bulk actions

     The set of commands starting with =k ...= as been deleted and the
     features have been merged into the "bulk action" feature.

     After you marked some entries in the agenda, if you call =B s=,
     the agenda entries will be rescheduled using the date at point if
     on a date header.  If you are on an entry with a timestamp, you
     will be prompted for a date to reschedule your marked entries to,
     using the timestamp at point as the default prompt.

     You can now use =k= to capture the marked entry and use the date
     at point as an overriding date for the capture template.

     To bind this behavior to =M-x org-capture RET= (or its
     keybinding), set the new option [[doc::org-capture-use-agenda-date][org-capture-use-agenda-date]] to
     =t=.

**** =N= and =P= in the agenda will move to the next/previous item

**** New command [[doc::org-agenda-bulk-mark-all][org-agenda-bulk-mark-all]] to mark all items

     This new command is bound to =*= in agenda mode.

     There is also a new option [[doc::org-agenda-bulk-mark-char][org-agenda-bulk-mark-char]] to set the
     character to use as a mark for bulk actions.

**** New option [[doc::org-agenda-persistent-marks][org-agenda-persistent-marks]]

     When set to =non-nil=, marks will remain visible after a bulk
     action.  You can temporarily toggle this by pressing =p= when
     invoking [[doc::org-agenda-bulk-action][org-agenda-bulk-action]].  Marks are deleted if your
     rebuild the agenda buffer or move to another date/span (e.g. with
     =f= or =w=).

**** New option [[doc::org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-deadline-is-shown][org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-deadline-is-shown]]

     =Non-nil= means skip timestamp line if same entry shows because
     of deadline.

     In the agenda of today, an entry can show up multiple times
     because it has both a plain timestamp and has a nearby deadline.
     When this variable is t, then only the deadline is shown and the
     fact that the entry has a timestamp for or including today is not
     shown.  When this variable is =nil=, the entry will be shown
     several times.

**** New =todo-unblocked= and =nottodo-unblocked= skip conditions

     See the [[http://orgmode.org/w/?p%3Dorg-mode.git%3Ba%3Dcommit%3Bh%3Df426da][git commit]] for more explanations.

**** Allow category filtering in the agenda

     You can now filter the agenda by category.  Pressing "<" will
     filter by the category of the item on the current line, and
     pressing "<" again will remove the filter.  You can combine tag
     filters and category filters.

     You can use =org-agenda-category-filter= in your custom agenda
     views and =org-agenda-category-filter-preset= in your main
     configuration.

     See also the new command [[doc::org-agenda-filter-by-top-category][org-agenda-filter-by-top-category]]:
     hitting =^= will filter by "Top" category: only show entries that
     are of the same category than the Top category of the entry at
     point.

*** Org Links

**** Inserting links

     When inserting links through [[doc::org-insert-link][org-insert-link]], the description is
     now displayed first, followed by the literal link, as the
     description is often more useful when you look for the link you
     want to insert.

     Completion now complete both literal links and description.  If
     you complete a description, the literal link and its description
     will be inserted directly, whereas when you complete the literal
     link, you will be prompted for a description (as with Org 7.8.)

     In the completion buffer, links to the current buffer are now
     highlighted.

**** New templates =%h= and =%(sexp)= for abbreviated links

     On top of =%s= template, which is replaced by the link tag in
     abbreviated links, you can now use =%h= (which does the same than =%s=
     but does not hexify the tag) and =%(sexp)= (which can run a function
     that takes the tag as its own argument.)

**** New link type =help=

     You can now create links from =help= buffers.

     For example, if you request help for the command [[doc::org-agenda][org-agenda]] with
     =C-h f org-agenda RET=, creating a link from this buffer will let
     you go back to the same buffer.

**** New command [[doc::org-insert-all-links][org-insert-all-links]]

     This will insert all links as list items.  With a universal
     prefix argument, links will not be deleted from the variable
     =org-stored-links=.

     This new command is bound to =C-c C-M-l=.

**** New option [[doc::org-url-hexify-p][org-url-hexify-p]]

     When set to =nil=, the =URL= part of a link will not be hexified.

**** Org can now open multiple shell links

**** New option [[doc::org-doi-server-url][org-doi-server-url]] to specify an alternate DOI server

**** RET now follows time stamps links

*** Org Editing

**** [[doc::org-todo][org-todo]] and =org-archive-*= can now loop in the active region

     When [[doc::org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region][org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region]] is =non-nil=, using
     [[doc::org-todo][org-todo]] or =org-archive-*= commands in the active region will
     loop over headlines.  This is handy if you want to set the TODO
     keyword for several items, or archive them quickly.

**** You can now set tags for headlines in a region

     If [[doc::org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region][org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region]] is =non-nil=, then
     selecting the region and hitting =C-c C-q= will set the tags for
     all headlines in the region.

**** New command [[doc::org-insert-drawer][org-insert-drawer]] to insert a drawer interactively

**** Comments start with "^[ \t]*# " anywhere on a line

     Note that the space after the hashtag is mandatory.  Comments
     with "^#+" are not supported anymore.

**** New speed key =#= to toggle the COMMENT cookie on a headline

**** =indent-region-function= is now set to [[doc::org-indent-region][org-indent-region]]

     =C-M-\= should now produce useful results.

     You can unindent the buffer with [[doc::org-unindent-buffer][org-unindent-buffer]].

**** New option [[doc::org-allow-promoting-top-level-subtree][org-allow-promoting-top-level-subtree]]

     When =non-nil=, =S-M-<left>= will promote level-1 subtrees
     containing other subtrees.  The level-1 headline will be
     commented out.  You can revert to the previous state with =M-x
     undo RET=.

*** Org Clock

**** New keybinding =C-c C-x C-z= for [[doc::org-clock-resolve][org-clock-resolve]]

**** New keybinding =C-c C-x C-q= for [[doc::org-clock-cancel][org-clock-cancel]]

**** New command [[doc::org-clock-in-last][org-clock-in-last]] to clock in the last clocked item

     This command is bound to =C-c C-x C-x= and will clock in the last
     clocked entry, if any.

**** =C-u M-x= [[doc::org-clock-out][org-clock-out]] =RET= now prompts for a state to switch to

**** =S-M-<up/down>= on a clock timestamps adjusts the previous/next clock

**** New option [[doc::org-clock-continuously][org-clock-continuously]]

     When set to =nil=, clocking in a task will first try to find the
     last clocked out task and restart from when that task was clocked
     out.

     You can temporarily activate continuous clocking with =C-u C-u
     C-u M-x= [[doc::org-clock-in][org-clock-in]] =RET= (three universal prefix arguments)
     and =C-u C-u M-x= [[org-clock-in-last][org-clock-in-last]] =RET= (two universal prefix
     arguments).


**** New option [[doc::org-clock-frame-title-format][org-clock-frame-title-format]]

     This option sets the value of =frame-title-format= when clocking
     in.

**** New options for controlling the clockreport display

     [[doc::org-clock-file-time-cell-format][org-clock-file-time-cell-format]]: Format string for the file time
     cells in clockreport.

     [[doc::org-clock-total-time-cell-format][org-clock-total-time-cell-format]]: Format string for the total
     time cells in clockreport.


**** New options for controlling the clock/timer display

     [[doc::org-clock-clocked-in-display][org-clock-clocked-in-display]]: control whether the current clock
     is displayed in the mode line and/or frame title.

     [[doc::org-timer-display][org-timer-display]]: control whether the current timer is displayed
     in the mode line and/or frame title.

     This allows the clock and timer to be displayed in the frame
     title instead of, or as well as, the mode line.  This is useful
     for people with limited space in the mode line but with ample
     space in the frame title.

*** Org Appearance

**** New option [[doc::org-custom-properties][org-custom-properties]]

     The visibility of properties listed in this options can be turn
     on/off with [[doc::org-toggle-custom-properties-visibility][org-toggle-custom-properties-visibility]].  This might
     be useful for properties used by third-part tools or that you
     don't want to see temporarily.

**** New command [[doc::org-redisplay-inline-images][org-redisplay-inline-images]]

     This will redisplay all images.  It is bound to =C-c C-x C-M-v=.

**** New entities in =org-entities.el=

     There are these new entities:

     : ("tilde" "\\~{}" nil "&tilde;" "~" "~" "~")
     : ("slash" "/" nil "/" "/" "/" "/")
     : ("plus" "+" nil "+" "+" "+" "+")
     : ("under" "\\_" nil "_" "_" "_" "_")
     : ("equal" "=" nil "=" "=" "=" "=")
     : ("asciicirc" "\\textasciicircum{}" nil "^" "^" "^" "^")

**** New face =org-list-dt= for definition terms
**** New face =org-date-selected= for the selected calendar day
**** New face value for =org-document-title=

     The face is back to a normal height.

*** Org Columns

**** New speed command =:= to activate the column view
**** New special property =CLOCKSUM_T= to display today's clocked time

     You can use =CLOCKSUM_T= the same way you use =CLOCKSUM=.  It
     will display the time spent on tasks for today only.

**** Use the =:COLUMNS:= property in columnview dynamic blocks

     If the =:COLUMNS:= is set in a subtree, the columnview dynamic
     block will use its value as the column format.

**** Consider inline tasks when computing a sum

*** Org Dates and Time Stamps

**** Enhanced [[doc::org-sparse-tree][org-sparse-tree]]

     =C-c /= can now check for time ranges.

     When checking for dates with =C-c /= it is useful to change the
     type of dates that you are interested in.  You can now do this
     interactively with =c= after =C-c /= and/or by setting
     [[doc::org-sparse-tree-default-date-type][org-sparse-tree-default-date-type]] to the default value you want.

**** Support for hourly repeat cookies

     You can now use

     : SCHEDULED: <2012-08-20 lun. 08:00 +1h>

     if you want to add an hourly repeater to an entry.

**** =C-u C-u C-c .= inserts a time-stamp with no prompt

**** When (setq [[doc::org-read-date-prefer-future][org-read-date-prefer-future]] 'time), accept days in the prompt

     "8am Wed" and "Wed 8am" are now acceptable values when entering a
     date from the prompt.  If [[doc::org-read-date-prefer-future][org-read-date-prefer-future]] is set to
     =time=, this will produce the expected prompt indication.

**** New option [[doc::org-datetree-add-timestamp][org-datetree-add-timestamp]]

     When set to =non-nil=, datetree entries will also have a
     timestamp.  This is useful if you want to see these entries in a
     sparse tree with =C-c /=.

*** Org Capture

**** New command [[doc::org-capture-string][org-capture-string]]

     M-x [[doc::org-capture-string][org-capture-string]] RET will prompt for a string and a capture
     template.  The string will be used as an annotation for the
     template.  This is useful when capturing in batch mode as it lets
     you define the content of the template without being in Emacs.

**** New option [[doc::org-capture-templates-contexts][org-capture-templates-contexts]]

     Setting this option allows you to define specific context where
     capture templates should be available from.  For example, when
     set to this value

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-capture-templates-contexts
        '(("c" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
#+END_SRC

     then the =c= capture template will only be available from
     =message-mode= buffers.  See the docstring and the manual for
     more details on how to use this.

**** New =%l= template to insert the literal link
**** New option [[doc::org-capture-bookmark][org-capture-bookmark]]

     Org used to automatically add a bookmark with capture a note.
     You can now turn this on by setting [[doc::org-capture-bookmark][org-capture-bookmark]] to
     =nil=.

**** Expand =%<num>= escape sequences into text entered for <num>'th =%^{PROMPT}= escape

     See the manual for more explanations.

**** More control over empty lines

     You can use =:empty-lines-before= and =:empty-lines-after= to
     control the insertion of empty lines.  Check the manual for more
     explanations.

**** New hook [[doc::org-capture-prepare-finalize-hook][org-capture-prepare-finalize-hook]]

     This new hook runs before the finalization process starts.

*** Org Export

**** New functions =orgtbl-to-table.el= and =orgtbl-to-unicode=

     =orgtbl-to-table.el= convert the table to a =table.el= table, and
     =orgtbl-to-unicode= will use =ascii-art-to-unicode.el= (when
     available) to print beautiful tables.

**** [[doc::org-table-export][org-table-export]] now a bit clever about the target format

     When you specify a file name like =table.csv=, [[doc::org-table-export][org-table-export]]
     will now suggest =orgtbl-to-csv= the default method for exporting
     the table.

**** New option [[doc::org-export-date-timestamp-format][org-export-date-timestamp-format]]

     The option allows to set a time string format for Org timestamps
     in the #+DATE option.

**** LaTeX: New options for exporting table rules :tstart, :hline and :tend

     See [[doc::org-export-latex-tables-hline][org-export-latex-tables-hline]] and [[doc::org-export-latex-tables-tend][org-export-latex-tables-tend]].

**** LaTeX: You can now set =:hfmt= from =#+ATTR_LaTeX=
**** Beamer: Add support and keybinding for the =exampleblock= environment

     Add support for these languages in [[doc::org-export-language-setup][org-export-language-setup]].
     More languages are always welcome.

**** Beamer: New option [[doc::org-beamer-inherited-properties][org-beamer-inherited-properties]]

     This option allows Beamer export to inherit some properties.
     Thanks to Carsten for implementing this.

**** ODT: Add support for ODT export in org-bbdb.el
**** ODT: Add support for indented tables (see [[http://orgmode.org/w/?p%3Dorg-mode.git%3Ba%3Dcommit%3Bh%3De9fd33][this commit]] for details)
**** ODT: Improve the conversion from ODT to other formats
**** ASCII: Swap the level-1/level-2 characters to underline the headlines
**** Support for Chinese, simplified Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian and Japanese
**** HTML: New option [[doc::org-export-html-date-format-string][org-export-html-date-format-string]]

     Format string to format the date and time in HTML export.  Thanks
     to Sébastien Vauban for this patch.

*** Miscellaneous

**** [[doc::org-table-number-regexp][org-table-number-regexp]] can now accept comma as decimal mark
**** Org allows a new property =APPT_WARNTIME=

     You can set it with the =W= speedy key or set it manually.  When
     set, exporting to iCalendar and [[doc::org-agenda-to-appt][org-agenda-to-appt]] will use the
     value of this property as the number of minutes for the warning
     alarm.

**** New command [[doc::org-inc-effort][org-inc-effort]]

     This will increment the effort value.

     It is bound to =C-c C-x E= and to =E= as a speedy command.

**** Attach: Add support for creating symbolic links

     =org-attach-method= now supports a new method =lns=, allowing to
     attach symbolic links.

**** Archive: you can now archive to a datetree

**** New option [[doc::org-inlinetask-show-first-star][org-inlinetask-show-first-star]]

     =Non-nil= means display the first star of an inline task as
     additional marker.  When =nil=, the first star is not shown.

**** New option [[doc::org-latex-preview-ltxpng-directory][org-latex-preview-ltxpng-directory]]

     This lets you define the path for the =ltxpng/= directory.

**** You can now use imagemagick instead of dvipng to preview LaTeX fragments
**** You can now turn off [[doc::orgstruct++-mode][orgstruct++-mode]] safely
**** =C-u C-c C-c= on list items to add check boxes

     =C-u C-c C-c= will add an empty check box on a list item.

     When hit from the top of the list, it will add check boxes for
     all top level list items.

**** =org-list-ending-method= and =org-list-end-regexp= are now obsolete

     Fall back on using =org-list-end-re= only, which see.

**** org-feed.el now expands =%(sexp)= templates
**** New option [[doc::org-protocol-data-separator][org-protocol-data-separator]]

**** New option [[doc::org-ditaa-jar-option][org-ditaa-jar-option]] to specify the ditaa jar file

**** New possible value for [[doc::org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region][org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region]]

     When [[doc::org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region][org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region]] is set to
     =start-level=, the command will loop over the active region but
     will only act upon entries that are of the same level than the
     first headline in the region.

**** New option [[doc::org-habit-show-all-today][org-habit-show-all-today]]

     When set to =t=, show all (even unscheduled) habits on today's
     agenda.

** Important bug fixes

*** M-TAB on options keywords perform completion correctly again

    If you hit =M-TAB= on keywords like =#+TITLE=, Org will try to
    perform completion with meaningful values.

*** Add licenses to javascript embedded and external code snippets

    Embedded javascript code produced when exporting an Org file to
    HTML is now licensed under GPLv3 (or later), and the copyright is
    owned by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

    The javascript code for embedding MathJax in the browser mentions
    the MathJax copyright and the Apache 2.0 license.

    The javascript code for embedding =org-injo.js= in the browser
    mentions the copyright of Sebastian Rose and the GPLv3 (or later)
    license.

    =org-export-html-scripts= is now a variable, so that you can adapt
    the code and the license to your needs.

* Version 7.8.11

** Incompatible changes

*** Emacs 21 support has been dropped

    Do not use Org mode 7.xx with Emacs 21, use [[http://orgmode.org/org-6.36c.zip][version 6.36c]] instead.

*** XEmacs support requires the XEmacs development version

    To use Org mode 7.xx with XEmacs, you need to run the developer
    version of XEmacs.  We were about to drop XEmacs support entirely,
    but Michael Sperber stepped in and made changes to XEmacs that
    made it easier to keep the support.  Thanks to Michael for this
    last-minute save.

*** New keys for TODO sparse trees

    The key =C-c C-v= is now reserved for Org Babel action.  TODO
    sparse trees can still be made with =C-c / t= (all not-done
    states) and =C-c / T= (specific states).

*** The Agenda =org-agenda-ndays= is now obsolete

    The variable =org-agenda-ndays= is obsolete - please use
    =org-agenda-span= instead.

    Thanks to Julien Danjou for this.

*** Changes to the intended use of =org-export-latex-classes=

    So far this variable has been used to specify the complete header
    of the LaTeX document, including all the =\usepackage= calls
    necessary for the document.  This setup makes it difficult to
    maintain the list of packages that Org itself would like to call,
    for example for the special symbol support it needs.

    First of all, you can *opt out of this change* in the following
    way: You can say: /I want to have full control over headers, and I
    will take responsibility to include the packages Org needs/.  If
    that is what you want, add this to your configuration and skip the
    rest of this section (except maybe for the description of the
    =[EXTRA]= place holder):

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq org-export-latex-default-packages-alist nil
         org-export-latex-packages-alist nil)
    #+end_src

    /Continue to read here if you want to go along with the modified
    setup./

    There are now two variables that should be used to list the LaTeX
    packages that need to be included in all classes.  The header
    definition in =org-export-latex-classes= should then not contain
    the corresponding =\usepackage= calls (see below).

    The two new variables are:

    1. =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist= :: This is the
         variable where Org-mode itself puts the packages it needs.
         Normally you should not change this variable.  The only
         reason to change it anyway is when one of these packages
         causes a conflict with another package you want to use.  Then
         you can remove that packages and hope that you are not using
         Org-mode functionality that needs it.

    2. =org-export-latex-packages-alist= :: This is the variable where
         you can put the packages that you'd like to use across all
         classes.

    The sequence how these customizations will show up in the LaTeX
    document are:

    1. Header from =org-export-latex-classes=
    2. =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=
    3. =org-export-latex-packages-alist=
    4. Buffer-specific things set with =#+LaTeX_HEADER:=

    If you want more control about which segment is placed where, or
    if you want, for a specific class, have full control over the
    header and exclude some of the automatic building blocks, you can
    put the following macro-like place holders into the header:

    #+begin_example
    [DEFAULT-PACKAGES]      \usepackage statements for default packages
    [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]   do not include any of the default packages
    [PACKAGES]              \usepackage statements for packages
    [NO-PACKAGES]           do not include the packages
    [EXTRA]                 the stuff from #+LaTeX_HEADER
    [NO-EXTRA]              do not include #+LaTeX_HEADER stuff
    #+end_example

    If you have currently customized =org-export-latex-classes=, you
    should revise that customization and remove any package calls that
    are covered by =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=.  This
    applies to the following packages:

    - inputenc
    - fontenc
    - fixltx2e
    - graphicx
    - longtable
    - float
    - wrapfig
    - soul
    - t1enc
    - textcomp
    - marvosym
    - wasysym
    - latexsym
    - amssymb
    - hyperref

    If one of these packages creates a conflict with another package
    you are using, you can remove it from
    =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=.  But then you risk that
    some of the advertised export features of Org will not work
    properly.

    You can also consider moving packages that you use in all classes
    to =org-export-latex-packages-alist=.  If necessary, put the place
    holders so that the packages get loaded in the right sequence.  As
    said above, for backward compatibility, if you omit the place
    holders, all the variables will dump their content at the end of
    the header.

*** The constant =org-html-entities= is obsolete

    Its content is now part of the new constant =org-entities=, which
    is defined in the file org-entities.el.  =org-html-entities= was
    an internal variable, but it is possible that some users did write
    code using it.

*** =org-bbdb-anniversary-format-alist= has changed

    Please check the docstring and update your settings accordingly.

*** Deleted =org-mode-p=

    This function has been deleted: please update your code.

** Important new features

*** New Org to ODT exporter

    Jambunathan's Org to ODT exporter is now part of Org.

    To use it, it `C-c C-e o' in an Org file.  See the documentation
    for more information on how to customize it.

*** org-capture.el is now the default capture system

    This replaces the earlier system org-remember.  The manual only
    describes org-capture, but for people who prefer to continue to
    use org-remember, we keep a static copy of the former manual
    section [[http://orgmode.org/org-remember.pdf][chapter about remember]].

    The new system has a technically cleaner implementation and more
    possibilities for capturing different types of data.  See
    [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/26441/focus%3D26441][Carsten's announcement]] for more details.

    To switch over to the new system:

    1. Run

     : M-x org-capture-import-remember-templates RET

       to get a translated version of your remember templates into the
       new variable =org-capture-templates=.  This will "mostly" work,
       but maybe not for all cases.  At least it will give you a good
       place to modify your templates.  After running this command,
       enter the customize buffer for this variable with

     : M-x customize-variable RET org-capture-templates RET

       and convince yourself that everything is OK.  Then save the
       customization.

    2. Bind the command =org-capture= to a key, similar to what you did
       with org-remember:

     : (define-key global-map "\C-cc" 'org-capture)

       If your fingers prefer =C-c r=, you can also use this key once
       you have decided to move over completely to the new
       implementation.  During a test time, there is nothing wrong
       with using both system in parallel.

** New libraries

*** New Org libraries
**** org-eshell.el (Konrad Hinsen)

     Implement links to eshell buffers.

**** org-special-blocks (Carsten Dominik)

     This package generalizes the #+begin_foo and #+end_foo tokens.

     To use, put the following in your init file:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'org-special-blocks)
#+END_EXAMPLE

     The tokens #+begin_center, #+begin_verse, etc. existed
     previously.  This package generalizes them (at least for the
     LaTeX and html exporters).  When a #+begin_foo token is
     encountered by the LaTeX exporter, it is expanded
     into \begin{foo}.  The text inside the environment is not
     protected, as text inside environments generally is.
     When #+begin_foo is encountered by the html exporter, a div with
     class foo is inserted into the HTML file.  It is up to the user
     to add this class to his or her stylesheet if this div is to mean
     anything.

**** org-taskjuggler.el (Christian Egli)

     Christian Egli's /org-taskjuggler.el/ module is now part of Org.
     He also wrote a [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler.php][tutorial]] for it.

**** org-ctags.el (Paul Sexton)

     Targets like =<<my target>>= can now be found by Emacs' etag
     functionality, and Org-mode links can be used to to link to
     etags, also in non-Org-mode files.  For details, see the file
     /org-ctags.el/.

     This feature uses a new hook =org-open-link-functions= which will
     call function to do something special with text links.

     Thanks to Paul Sexton for this contribution.

**** org-docview.el (Jan Böcker)

     This new module allows links to various file types using docview, where
     Emacs displays images of document pages.  Docview link types can point
     to a specific page in a document, for example to page 131 of the
     Org-mode manual:

     : [[docview:~/.elisp/org/doc/org.pdf::131][Org-Mode Manual]]

     Thanks to Jan Böcker for this contribution.

*** New Babel libraries

- ob-picolisp.el (Thorsten Jolitz)
- ob-fortran.el (Sergey Litvinov)
- ob-shen.el (Eric Schulte)
- ob-maxima.el (Eric S Fraga)
- ob-java.el (Eric Schulte)
- ob-lilypond.el (Martyn Jago)
- ob-awk.el (Eric Schulte)

** Other new features and various enhancements

*** Hyperlinks

**** Org-Bibtex -- major improvements

     Provides support for managing bibtex bibliographical references
     data in headline properties.  Each headline corresponds to a
     single reference and the relevant bibliographic meta-data is
     stored in headline properties, leaving the body of the headline
     free to hold notes and comments.  Org-bibtex is aware of all
     standard bibtex reference types and fields.

     The key new functions are

     - org-bibtex-check :: queries the user to flesh out all required
          (and with prefix argument optional) bibtex fields available
          for the specific reference =type= of the current headline.

     - org-bibtex-create :: Create a new entry at the given level,
          using org-bibtex-check to flesh out the relevant fields.

     - org-bibtex-yank :: Yank a bibtex entry on the kill ring as a
          formatted Org-mode headline into the current buffer

     - org-bibtex-export-to-kill-ring :: Export the current headline
          to the kill ring as a formatted bibtex entry.

**** org-gnus.el now allows link creation from messages

     You can now create links from messages.  This is particularily
     useful when the user wants to stored messages that he sends, for
     later check.  Thanks to Ulf Stegemann for the patch.

**** Modified link escaping

     David Maus worked on `org-link-escape'.  See [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/37888][his message]]:

     : Percent escaping is used in Org mode to escape certain characters
     : in links that would either break the parser (e.g. square brackets
     : in link target oder description) or are not allowed to appear in
     : a particular link type (e.g. non-ascii characters in a http:
     : link).
     :
     : With this change in place Org will apply percent escaping and
     : unescaping more consistently especially for non-ascii characters.
     : Additionally some of the outstanding bugs or glitches concerning
     : percent escaped links are solved.

     Thanks a lot to David for this work.

**** Make =org-store-link= point to directory in a dired buffer

     When, in a dired buffer, the cursor is not in a line listing a
     file, `org-store-link' will store a link to the directory.

     Patch by Stephen Eglen.

**** Allow regexps in =org-file-apps= to capture link parameters

     The way extension regexps in =org-file-apps= are handled has
     changed.  Instead of matching against the file name, the regexps
     are now matched against the whole link, and you can use grouping
     to extract link parameters which you can then use in a command
     string to be executed.

     For example, to allow linking to PDF files using the syntax
     =file:/doc.pdf::<page number>=, you can add the following entry
     to org-file-apps:

     #+begin_example
     Extension: \.pdf::\([0-9]+\)\'
     Command:   evince "%s" -p %1
     #+end_example

     Thanks to Jan Böcker for a patch to this effect.

*** Dates and time

**** Allow relative time when scheduling/adding a deadline

     You can now use relative duration strings like "-2d" or "++3w"
     when calling =org-schedule= or =org-deadline=: it will schedule
     (or set the deadline for) the item respectively two days before
     today and three weeks after the current timestamp, if any.

     You can use this programmatically: =(org-schedule nil "+2d")=
     will work on the current entry.

     You can also use this while (bulk-)rescheduling and
     (bulk-)resetting the deadline of (several) items from the agenda.

     Thanks to Memnon Anon for a heads up about this!

**** American-style dates are now understood by =org-read-date=

     So when you are prompted for a date, you can now answer like this

     #+begin_example
     2/5/3         --> 2003-02-05
     2/5           --> <CURRENT-YEAR>-02-05
     #+end_example

*** Agenda

**** =org-agenda-custom-commands= has a default value

     This option used to be `nil' by default.  This now has a default
     value, displaying an agenda and all TODOs.  See the docstring for
     details.  Thanks to Carsten for this.

**** Improved filtering through =org-agenda-to-appt=

     The new function allows the user to refine the scope of entries
     to pass to =org-agenda-get-day-entries= and allows to filter out
     entries using a function.

     Thanks to Peter Münster for raising a related issue and to
     Tassilo Horn for this idea.  Also thanks to Peter Münster for
     [[git:68ffb7a7][fixing a small bug]] in the final implementation.

**** Allow ap/pm times in agenda time grid

     Times in the agenda can now be displayed in am/pm format.  See
     the new variable =org-agenda-timegrid-use-ampm=.  Thanks to
     C. A. Webber for a patch to this effect.

**** Agenda: Added a bulk "scattering" command

     =B S= in the agenda buffer will cause tasks to be rescheduled a
     random number of days into the future, with 7 as the default.
     This is useful if you've got a ton of tasks scheduled for today,
     you realize you'll never deal with them all, and you just want
     them to be distributed across the next N days.  When called with
     a prefix arg, rescheduling will avoid weekend days.

     Thanks to John Wiegley for this.

*** Exporting

**** Simplification of org-export-html-preamble/postamble

     When set to `t', export the preamble/postamble as usual, honoring
     the =org-export-email/author/creator-info= variables.

     When set to a formatting string, insert this string.  See the
     docstring of these variable for details about available
     %-sequences.

     You can set =:html-preamble= in publishing project in the same
     way: `t' means to honor =:email/creator/author-info=, and a
     formatting string will insert a string.

**** New exporters to Latin-1 and UTF-8

     While Ulf Stegemann was going through the entities list to
     improve the LaTeX export, he had the great idea to provide
     representations for many of the entities in Latin-1, and for all
     of them in UTF-8.  This means that we can now export files rich
     in special symbols to Latin-1 and to UTF-8 files.  These new
     exporters can be reached with the commands =C-c C-e n= and =C-c
     C-e u=, respectively.

     When there is no representation for a given symbol in the
     targeted coding system, you can choose to keep the TeX-macro-like
     representation, or to get an "explanatory" representation.  For
     example, =\simeq= could be represented as "[approx. equal to]".
     Please use the variable =org-entities-ascii-explanatory= to state
     your preference.

**** HTML export: Add class to outline containers using property

     The =HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS= property can now be used to add a
     class name to the outline container of a node in HTML export.

**** Throw an error when creating an image from a LaTeX snippet fails

     This behavior can be configured with the new option variable
     =org-format-latex-signal-error=.

**** Support for creating BEAMER presentations from Org-mode documents

     Org-mode documents or subtrees can now be converted directly in
     to BEAMER presentation.  Turning a tree into a simple
     presentations is straight forward, and there is also quite some
     support to make richer presentations as well.  See the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Beamer-class-export.html#Beamer-class-export][BEAMER
     section]] in the manual for more details.

     Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the discussion about
     BEAMER support and how it should work.  This was a great example
     for how this community can achieve a much better result than any
     individual could.

*** Refiling

**** Refile targets can now be cached

     You can turn on caching of refile targets by setting the variable
     =org-refile-use-cache=.  This should speed up refiling if you
     have many eligible targets in many files.  If you need to update
     the cache because Org misses a newly created entry or still
     offers a deleted one, press =C-0 C-c C-w=.

**** New logging support for refiling

     Whenever you refile an item, a time stamp and even a note can be
     added to this entry.  For details, see the new option
     =org-log-refile=.

     Thanks to Charles Cave for this idea.

*** Completion

**** In-buffer completion is now done using John Wiegleys pcomplete.el

     Thanks to John Wiegley for much of this code.

*** Tables

**** New command =org-table-transpose-table-at-point=

     See the docstring.  This hack from Juan Pechiar is now part of
     Org's core.  Thanks to Juan!

**** Display field's coordinates when editing it with =C-c `=

     When editing a field with =C-c `=, the field's coordinate will
     the displayed in the buffer.

     Thanks to Michael Brand for a patch to this effect.

**** Spreadsheet computation of durations and time values

     If you want to compute time values use the =T= flag, either in
     Calc formulas or Elisp formulas:

     | Task 1 | Task 2 |   Total |
     |--------+--------+---------|
     |  35:00 |  35:00 | 1:10:00 |
     #+TBLFM: @2$3=$1+$2;T

     Values must be of the form =[HH:]MM:SS=, where hours are
     optional.

     Thanks to Martin Halder, Eric Schulte and Carsten for code and
     feedback on this.

**** Implement formulas applying to field ranges

     Carsten implemented this field-ranges formulas.

     : A frequently requested feature for tables has been to be able to define
     : row formulas in a way similar to column formulas.  The patch below allows
     : things like
     :
     : @3=
     : @2$2..@5$7=
     : @I$2..@II$4=
     :
     : as the left hand side for table formulas in order to write a formula that
     : is valid for an entire column or for a rectangular section in a
     : table.

     Thanks a lot to Carsten for this.

**** Sending radio tables from org buffers is now allowed

     Org radio tables can no also be sent inside Org buffers.  Also,
     there is a new hook which get called after a table has been sent.

     Thanks to Seweryn Kokot.

*** Lists

**** Improved handling of lists

     Nicolas Goaziou extended and improved the way Org handles lists.

     1. Indentation of text determines again end of items in
        lists. So, some text less indented than the previous item
        doesn't close the whole list anymore, only all items more
        indented than it.

     2. Alphabetical bullets are implemented, through the use of the
        variable `org-alphabetical-lists'. This also adds alphabetical
        counters like [@c] or [@W].

     3. Lists can now safely contain drawers, inline tasks, or various
        blocks, themselves containing lists. Two variables are
        controlling this: `org-list-forbidden-blocks', and
        `org-list-export-context'.

     4. Improve `newline-and-indent' (C-j): used in an item, it will
        keep text from moving at column 0. This allows to split text
        and make paragraphs and still not break the list.

     5. Improve `org-toggle-item' (C-c -): used on a region with
        standard text, it will change the region into one item. With a
        prefix argument, it will fallback to the previous behavior and
        make every line in region an item. It permits to easily
        integrate paragraphs inside a list.

     6. `fill-paragraph' (M-q) now understands lists. It can freely be
        used inside items, or on text just after a list, even with no
        blank line around, without breaking list structure.

     Thanks a lot to Nicolas for all this!

*** Inline display of linked images

    Images can now be displayed inline.  The key C-c C-x C-v does
    toggle the display of such images.  Note that only image links
    that have no description part will be inlined.

*** Implement offsets for ordered lists

    If you want to start an ordered plain list with a number different
    from 1, you can now do it like this:

    : 1. [@start:12] will star a lit a number 12

*** Babel: code block body expansion for table and preview

    In org-babel, code is "expanded" prior to evaluation. I.e. the
    code that is actually evaluated comprises the code block contents,
    augmented with the extra code which assigns the referenced data to
    variables. It is now possible to preview expanded contents, and
    also to expand code during during tangling. This expansion takes
    into account all header arguments, and variables.

    A new keybinding `C-c M-b p' bound to `org-babel-expand-src-block'
    can be used from inside of a source code block to preview its
    expanded contents (which can be very useful for debugging).
    tangling

    The expanded body can now be tangled, this includes variable
    values which may be the results of other source-code blocks, or
    stored in headline properties or tables. One possible use for this
    is to allow those using org-babel for their emacs initialization
    to store values (e.g. usernames, passwords, etc...) in headline
    properties or in tables.

    Org-babel now supports three new header arguments, and new default
    behavior for handling horizontal lines in tables (hlines), column
    names, and rownames across all languages.

*** Editing Convenience and Appearance

**** New command =org-copy-visible= (=C-c C-x v=)

     This command will copy the visible text in the region into the
     kill ring.  Thanks to Florian Beck for this function and to
     Carsten for adding it to org.el and documenting it!

**** Make it possible to protect hidden subtrees from being killed by =C-k=

     See the new variable =org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree=.  This was a
     request by Scott Otterson.

**** Implement pretty display of entities, sub-, and superscripts.

     The command =C-c C-x \= toggles the display of Org's special
     entities like =\alpha= as pretty unicode characters.  Also, sub
     and superscripts are displayed in a pretty way (raised/lower
     display, in a smaller font).  If you want to exclude sub- and
     superscripts, see the variable
     =org-pretty-entities-include-sub-superscripts=.

     Thanks to Eric Schulte and Ulf Stegeman for making this possible.

**** New faces for title, date, author and email address lines

     The keywords in these lines are now dimmed out, and the title is
     displayed in a larger font, and a special font is also used for
     author, date, and email information.  This is implemented by the
     following new faces:

     =org-document-title=
     =org-document-info=
     =org-document-info-keyword=

     In addition, the variable =org-hidden-keywords= can be used to
     make the corresponding keywords disappear.

     Thanks to Dan Davison for this feature.

**** Simpler way to specify faces for tags and todo keywords

     The variables =org-todo-keyword-faces=, =org-tag-faces=, and
     =org-priority-faces= now accept simple color names as
     specifications.  The colors will be used as either foreground or
     background color for the corresponding keyword.  See also the
     variable =org-faces-easy-properties=, which governs which face
     property is affected by this setting.

     This is really a great simplification for setting keyword faces.
     The change is based on an idea and patch by Ryan Thompson.

**** <N> in tables now means fixed width, not maximum width

     Requested by Michael Brand.

**** Better level cycling function

     =TAB= in an empty headline cycles the level of that headline
     through likely states.  Ryan Thompson implemented an improved
     version of this function, which does not depend upon when exactly
     this command is used.  Thanks to Ryan for this improvement.

**** Adaptive filling

     For paragraph text, =org-adaptive-fill-function= did not handle
     the base case of regular text which needed to be filled.  This is
     now fixed.  Among other things, it allows email-style ">"
     comments to be filled correctly.

     Thanks to Dan Hackney for this patch.

**** `org-reveal' (=C-c C-r=) also decrypts encrypted entries (org-crypt.el)

     Thanks to Richard Riley for triggering this change.

**** Better automatic letter selection for TODO keywords

     When all first letters of keywords have been used, Org now
     assigns more meaningful characters based on the keywords.

     Thanks to Mikael Fornius for this patch.

*** Clocking

**** Clock: Allow synchronous update of timestamps in CLOCK log

     Using =S-M-<up/down>= on CLOCK log timestamps will
     increase/decrease the two timestamps on this line so that
     duration will keep the same.  Note that duration can still be
     slightly modified in case a timestamp needs some rounding.

     Thanks to Rainer Stengele for this idea.

**** Localized clock tables

     Clock tables now support a new new =:lang= parameter, allowing
     the user to customize the localization of the table headers.  See
     the variable =org-clock-clocktable-language-setup= which controls
     available translated strings.

**** Show clock overruns in mode line

     When clocking an item with a planned effort, overrunning the
     planned time is now made visible in the mode line, for example
     using the new face =org-mode-line-clock-overrun=, or by adding an
     extra string given by =org-task-overrun-text=.

     Thanks to Richard Riley for a patch to this effect.

**** Clock reports can now include the running, incomplete clock

     If you have a clock running, and the entry being clocked falls
     into the scope when creating a clock table, the time so far spent
     can be added to the total.  This behavior depends on the setting
     of =org-clock-report-include-clocking-task=.  The default is
     =nil=.

     Thanks to Bernt Hansen for this useful addition.

*** Misc

**** Improvements with inline tasks and indentation

     There is now a configurable way on how to export inline tasks.
     See the new variable =org-inlinetask-export-templates=.

     Thanks to Nicolas Goaziou for coding these changes.

**** A property value of "nil" now means to unset a property

     This can be useful in particular with property inheritance, if
     some upper level has the property, and some grandchild of it
     would like to have the default settings (i.e. not overruled by a
     property) back.

     Thanks to Robert Goldman and Bernt Hansen for suggesting this
     change.

**** New helper functions in org-table.el

     There are new functions to access and write to a specific table field.
     This is for hackers, and maybe for the org-babel people.

     #+begin_example
     org-table-get
     org-table-put
     org-table-current-line
     org-table-goto-line
     #+end_example

**** Archiving: Allow to reverse order in target node

     The new option =org-archive-reversed-order= allows to have
     archived entries inserted in a last-on-top fashion in the target
     node.

     This was requested by Tom.

**** Org-reveal: Double prefix arg shows the entire subtree of the parent

     This can help to get out of an inconsistent state produced for
     example by viewing from the agenda.

     This was a request by Matt Lundin.
