;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library implements a Man back-end for Org generic exporter.
;;
;; To test it, run
;;
;;   M-: (org-export-to-buffer 'e-man "*Test e-Man*") RET
;;
;; in an org-mode buffer then switch to the buffer to see the Man
;; export.  See contrib/lisp/org-export.el for more details on how
;; this exporter works.
;;
;; It introduces one new buffer keywords:
;; "MAN_CLASS_OPTIONS".
