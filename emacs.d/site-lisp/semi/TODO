======

* MIME-View

** dynamic configuration for 'mime-preview-condition

** Don't expect raw-buffer

** lazy generating of situations from mime-entity information


* MIME-Edit

** WYSIWYG editing support

** Use MIME-Preview like tag and display

** Redesign to use two buffers for one message

  MIME-View is based on "Multiple Representation Space (layer) Model".
In this model, network representation and its presentation are
distinguished.  Thus MIME-View uses two buffers for one message,
'mime-raw-buffer (for network representation) and
'mime-preview-buffer.  MIME-View manages them based on information of
entities.  According to experience of MIME-View, this model is good to
treat complex structured data, such as MIME.

  MIME-Edit was designed to use one buffer for one message.  So it is
hard to edit like WYSIWYG style.  Format of tag is limited by
translation.  Content of forwarded message is unreadable.  It is
better to introduce "Multiple Representation Space Model" to resolve
these problems.

** Check available MIME-charset

    MIME-charset 以外が生成される場合の処理を指定できるようにする。

    For example:

        (a) translate problematic characters to similar representation
	(b) display warning message
	    (e.g. "`x-ctext' is generated.  Do you send it? (yes/no)")
	(c) stop sending

** Don't use buffer-local variables

  Don't use buffer-local variables to control behavior about
translating to network representation, such as 'mime-transfer-level,
'mime-transfer-level-string,
'mime-edit-charset-default-encoding-alist, 'mime-edit-pgp-processing.
Because they have problem with Semi-gnus.


* Etc.

** Write manual
