;;; APEL-ELS --- list of APEL modules to install. -*-Emacs-Lisp-*-

;;; Commentary:

;; APEL-MK imports `apel-modules' from here.

;;; Code:

(defvar apel-modules '(alist calist path-util filename install
			     ;; "mule-caesar" is version-dependent.
			     ;; moved to EMU-ELS.
			     ;; mule-caesar

			     ;; [obsoleted modules] If you would like to
			     ;; install following, please activate them.
			     ;; atype file-detect
			     ))

;;; APEL-ELS ends here
