;;; APEL-CFG --- user customizations for APEL installation. -*-Emacs-Lisp-*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Use this file to override variables defined in APEL-MK.
;;
;; The following variables are used in APEL-MK.
;; Note that you cannot use them in this file.
;;
;; For Emacs, or XEmacs without package system:
;;
;; PREFIX:	Normally, "/usr/local".
;;		Installer will try to detect it automatically.
;; LISPDIR:	"PREFIX/share/emacs/site-lisp" if Emacs 19.29 and later.
;;		"PREFIX/lib/emacs/site-lisp" if Emacs 19.28 and earlier.
;;		Installer will try to detect it from PREFIX.
;; VERSION_SPECIFIC_LISPDIR:	"PREFIX/share/emacs/VERSION/site-lisp"
;;		if Emacs 19.31 and later, otherwise, same as LISPDIR.
;;
;; APEL_PREFIX:	subdirectory of LISPDIR where APEL modules will be
;;		installed, or "" if you don't want to make subdirectory.
;; EMU_PREFIX:	subdirectory of VERSION_SPECIFIC_LISPDIR where EMU
;;		modules will be installed, or "" if you don't want to
;;		make subdirectory.
;;
;; APEL_DIR:	The directory where APEL modules will be installed.
;;		Generated from LISPDIR and APEL_PREFIX if it is not set.
;; EMU_DIR:	The directory where EMU modules will be installed.
;;		Generated from VERSION_SPECIFIC_LISPDIR and EMU_PREFIX
;;		if it is not set.
;;
;; For XEmacs with package system:
;;
;; PACKAGEDIR:	"/usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages"
;;		Installer will try to detect it automatically.
;;
;; APEL_PREFIX:	subdirectory of PACKAGEDIR where both APEL and EMU
;;		modules will be installed.

;;; Code:

;;; "custom" library.

;; If you want to use "new custom" but do not use "subdirs.el" to add
;; "custom" directory to your load-path, uncomment and edit this.
;; (setq load-path
;;       (cons "/usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp/custom" load-path))


;;; Install to home directory.

;; If you want to install APEL to your home directory and you already
;; have the standard hierarchy such as "~/share/emacs/site-lisp" and
;; "~/share/emacs/VERSION/site-lisp", uncomment and edit this.
;; (setq PREFIX "~/")

;; Or, you can specify APEL_DIR and EMU_DIR directly.
;; (setq APEL_DIR "~/lib/emacs/lisp/apel")
;; (setq EMU_DIR "~/lib/emacs/lisp/emu")


;;; Install to site-lisp directories.

;; (setq PREFIX "/usr/local")

;; Mule based on Emacs 19.28 and earlier.
;; (setq LISPDIR "/usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp")
;; Mule based on Emacs 19.29 and later.
;; (setq LISPDIR "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp")
;; (setq LISPDIR "/usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp")
;; (setq VERSION_SPECIFIC_LISPDIR "/usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp")
;; (setq VERSION_SPECIFIC_LISPDIR "/usr/local/share/mule/19.34/site-lisp")

;; XEmacs 21.0 and later.
;; (setq PACKAGEDIR "/usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages")

;; (setq APEL_PREFIX "apel")
;; (setq EMU_PREFIX "emu")

;; If you want to install all of APEL modules to VERSION_SPECIFIC_LISPDIR,
;; uncomment and edit this.
;; (setq APEL_DIR "/usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp/apel")

;; You can specify APEL_DIR and EMU_DIR directly.  Uncomment and edit this.
;; (setq APEL_DIR "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/apel")
;; (setq EMU_DIR "/usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp/emu")

;;; APEL-CFG ends here
