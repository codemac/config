    "Use FORMAT-STRING to format the time TIME, or now if omitted.
TIME is specified as (HIGH LOW . IGNORED) or (HIGH . LOW), as returned by
`current-time' or `file-attributes'.
The third, optional, argument UNIVERSAL, if non-nil, means describe TIME
as Universal Time; nil means describe TIME in the local time zone.
The value is a copy of FORMAT-STRING, but with certain constructs replaced
by text that describes the specified date and time in TIME:

%Y is the year, %y within the century, %C the century.
%G is the year corresponding to the ISO week, %g within the century.
%m is the numeric month.
%b and %h are the locale's abbreviated month name, %B the full name.
%d is the day of the month, zero-padded, %e is blank-padded.
%u is the numeric day of week from 1 (Monday) to 7, %w from 0 (Sunday) to 6.
%a is the locale's abbreviated name of the day of week, %A the full name.
%U is the week number starting on Sunday, %W starting on Monday,
 %V according to ISO 8601.
%j is the day of the year.

%H is the hour on a 24-hour clock, %I is on a 12-hour clock, %k is like %H
 only blank-padded, %l is like %I blank-padded.
%p is the locale's equivalent of either AM or PM.
%M is the minute.
%S is the second.
%Z is the time zone name, %z is the numeric form.
%s is the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000.

%c is the locale's date and time format.
%x is the locale's \"preferred\" date format.
%D is like \"%m/%d/%y\".

%R is like \"%H:%M\", %T is like \"%H:%M:%S\", %r is like \"%I:%M:%S %p\".
%X is the locale's \"preferred\" time format.

Finally, %n is a newline, %t is a tab, %% is a literal %.

Certain flags and modifiers are available with some format controls.
The flags are `_' and `-'.  For certain characters X, %_X is like %X,
but padded with blanks; %-X is like %X, but without padding.
%NX (where N stands for an integer) is like %X,
but takes up at least N (a number) positions.
The modifiers are `E' and `O'.  For certain characters X,
%EX is a locale's alternative version of %X;
%OX is like %X, but uses the locale's number symbols.

For example, to produce full ISO 8601 format, use \"%Y-%m-%dT%T%z\".

Compatibility Note.

Those format constructs are yet to be implemented.

  "Split STRING into substrings bounded by matches for SEPARATORS.

The beginning and end of STRING, and each match for SEPARATORS, are
splitting points.  The substrings matching SEPARATORS are removed, and
the substrings between the splitting points are collected as a list,
which is returned.

If SEPARATORS is non-nil, it should be a regular expression matching text
which separates, but is not part of, the substrings.  If nil it defaults to
`split-string-default-separators', normally \"[ \\f\\t\\n\\r\\v]+\", and
OMIT-NULLS is forced to t.

If OMIT-NULLS is t, zero-length substrings are omitted from the list \(so
that for the default value of SEPARATORS leading and trailing whitespace
are effectively trimmed).  If nil, all zero-length substrings are retained,
which correctly parses CSV format, for example.

Note that the effect of `(split-string STRING)' is the same as
`(split-string STRING split-string-default-separators t)').  In the rare
case that you wish to retain zero-length substrings when splitting on
whitespace, use `(split-string STRING split-string-default-separators)'.
