;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements globally unique identifiers for Org-mode entries.
;; Identifiers are stored in the entry as an :ID: property.  Functions
;; are provided that create and retrieve such identifiers, and that find
;; entries based on the identifier.

;; Identifiers consist of a prefix (default "Org") and a compact encoding
;; of the creation time of the ID, with microsecond accuracy.  This virtually
;; guarantees globally unique identifiers, even if several people are
;; creating ID's at the same time in files that will eventually be used
;; together.  Even higher security can be achieved by using different
;; prefix values for each collaborator or file.
;;
;; This file defines the following API:
;;
;; org-id-get-create
;;        Create an ID for the entry at point if it does not yet have one.
;;        Returns the ID (old or new).  This function can be used
;;        interactively, with prefix argument the creation of a new ID is
;;        forced, even if there was an old one.
;;
;; org-id-get
;;        Get the ID property of an entry.  Using appropriate arguments
;;        to the function, it can also create the ID for this entry.
;;
;; org-id-goto
;;        Command to go to a specific ID, this command can be used
;;        interactively.
;;
;; org-id-get-with-outline-path-completion
;;        Retrieve the ID of an entry, using outline path completion.
;;        This function can work for multiple files.
;;
;; org-id-get-with-outline-drilling
;;        Retrieve the ID of an entry, using outline path completion.
;;        This function only works for the current file.
;;
;; org-id-find
;;        Find the location of an entry with specific id.
