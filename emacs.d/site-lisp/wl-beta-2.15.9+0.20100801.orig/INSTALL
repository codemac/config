System Requirements
===================

  Wanderlust supports following Emacsen:

	Mule 2.3 based on Emacs 19.34
	Emacs 20.1 or later
	XEmacs 20.4 or later

  Before installing Wanderlust, please install the following MIME
  modules.

	SEMI	(1.14.6 or later)
	FLIM	(1.14.9 or later)

  Wanderlust and MIME modules require APEL.  Before installing MIME
  modules, please install the APEL.

	APEL	(10.6 or later)


Select MIME Module
==================

  For each Emacsen, Recommended combination of MIME module package
  follows.

  (a) XEmacs 21.1 or later

	APEL 10.8, FLIM 1.14.9, SEMI 1.14.6

    Installation as a XEmacs package, If possible.

  (b) Emacs 20.4 or later

	APEL 10.8, FLIM 1.14.9, SEMI 1.14.6

 (c) Emacs 20.1 to 20.3

	APEL 10.8, CLIME 1.14.6, SEMI 1.14.6

    Use CLIME instead of FLIM.  FLIM does not support Emacs 20.3 or
    earlier.

  (d) Emacs 19.34 (Mule 2.3)

	APEL 10.8, CLIME 1.14.6, SEMI 1.14.6

    Mule based on Emacs 19.34 can also run SEMI.  See the following web
    page to get more information (in Japanese).

	http://www.jpl.org/elips/INSTALL-SEMI-ja.html


Install MIME Module
===================

  You can download these packages from following URLs.

	APEL:	ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/
	FLIM:	ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/flim/
	CLIME:	ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/m17n/
	SEMI:	ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/semi/

  Please install APEL, FLIM(CLIME), and SEMI, in that order.  Generally,
  'make install' will do the job.  To get full information, please refer
  to the README.en within each package.

  You can also use many other FLIM/SEMI variants.  Combination of the
  latest versions should work.  For example, the following combinations
  are confirmed to work:

	APEL 10.6, SLIM 1.14.9, SEMI 1.14.5
	APEL 10.6, CLIME 1.14.5, EMIKO 1.14.1

  You have to re-install Wanderlust if you upgraded APEL, FLIM, or SEMI.


Check Environment
=================

  Before going to the next step, we recommend you to run tests by

	% make check
  or
	% make EMACS=xemacs check

  to check running environment including the version of APEL, FLIM, and
  SEMI.  Note that even if you have installed new APEL/FLIM/SEMI, old
  ones in load-path may cause trouble.  To find duplicated files in the
  load-path, M-x list-load-path-shadows will help you.


Installation
============

(a) Edit Makefile, WL-CFG

  Edit EMACS, LISPDIR, and so on in Makefile.

	EMACS      Emacs command name.
	LISPDIR    site-lisp directory.

  If LISPDIR is not specified (or NONE by default), it is automatically
  detected.

  Edit WL-CFG if you need. You can specify language for INFO, etc.

(b) Bytecompile and Install

  Please do following.

	% make
	% make install

  If you use Emacs without subdirs.el, the following error message
  occasionally appears.

	Cannot open load file: mime-setup

  In this case, add directories of custom, APEL, FLIM, SEMI to
  EMACSLOADPATH (environment variable), or add those directories to
  load-path in WL-CFG.


Install as a XEmacs package
===========================

  Wanderlust is able to be installed as one of XEmacs (21.0 or later)
  packages.  After installation as a XEmacs package, you do not need
  configurations of autoload, icon path in your own .emacs file.

(a) Edit Makefile, WL-CFG

  Edit XEMACS, PACKAGEDIR, and so on in Makefile.

	XEMACS      XEmacs command name.
	PACKAGEDIR  package directory.

  If PACKAGEDIR is not specified (NONE by default) and the SEMI
  modules have been installed, it is automatically detected.

  Edit WL-CFG if you need. You can specify language for INFO, etc.

(b) Bytecompile and Install

  Please do following.

	% make package
	% make install-package

  Install with Info file.


load-path
=========

  If you are using Emacs 20.3 or later, or XEmacs, there is no need
  to set load-path.

  If you are using Emacs 20.2 or earlier, please add the directory of
  Wanderlust to load-path.

  If you install by default setting, with Emacs 19.29 or later, Emacs
  20.1, or Emacs 20.2, you can write subdirs.el for example:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
    (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path
     '("apel" "flim" "semi" "wl"))
  --------------------------------------------------------------------


Manual
======

  Manual is described in Info format. Please do following.

	% make info
	% make install-info

  If you install Wanderlust as a XEmacs package, Info file is already
  installed too, so there are no need of these commands.

  Manual directory is automatically detected. Of course, it can be
  configured by INFODIR in Makefile.


Sample configuration file
=========================

  Wanderlust requires the following three configuration files:

	~/.wl           Wanderlust Configuration (loaded at startup)
	~/.folders      Folder Book
	~/.addresses    Address Book (optional)

  Each sample file (dot.addresses, dot.folders, dot.wl) exists on
  samples/en/ directory. Please refer to them.

  To get full information, please read Info file.
