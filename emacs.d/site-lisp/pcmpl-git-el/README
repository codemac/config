This project provides completion support for `git' in Emacs in places
pcomplete is used (mainly eshell).

* install

  Place file pcmpl-git.el in `load-path' and git-options in
  `data-directory' by default. You can put file git-options anywhere
  and customise `pcmpl-git-options-file' to point to it.

  File pcmpl-git-parse.el is not needed for running this package. It
  is only used for generating git-options.

* usage

  Complete both git commands and their options and arguments. Type '-'
  to complete short options and '--' to complete long options. For
  commands that accept commit as argument, branches and tags will be
  tried first and then the sha1's in the first few hundred commits.
