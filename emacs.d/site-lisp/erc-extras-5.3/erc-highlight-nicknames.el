;;; Commentary:
;; To activate this module, put this in your init file
;;     (require 'erc-highlight-nicknames)
;; and add highlight-nicknames to `erc-modules' by customizing it.

;; Or put this in your init file
;;     (and
;;      (load-library "erc-highlight-nicknames")
;;      (add-to-list 'erc-modules 'highlight-nicknames)
;;      (erc-update-modules))

;; Press
;;     M-x customize-face RET erc-highlight-nick-base-face RET
;; to customize the face that will be added before the color, if you want
;; for example all the nicks underlined.

;;; Change Log:
;; 2008-12-07  Andy Stewart
;;   * There was a bug that function `erc-highlight-nicknames' created
;;     many faces for the same nickname. It would create a new one when
;;     erc inserts text, and didn't care whether a face already existed
;;     for this nickname.
;;     Now I added a hash table `erc-highlight-face-table' to save the
;;     face for a nickname. Faces are now only created, if the nickname
;;     doesn't occur in the hash table.
;; 2007-12-24  andre-r
;;   * bug fixed in invert-color where color code contained spaces instead
;;     of leading zeros
;; 2007-12-12  andre-r
;;   * erc-highlight-nick-base-face is by default empty now,
;;     not inherited from `default'
;;   * erc-button-add-face instead of put-text-property
;;   * using `x-color-values' instead of `color-values' since XEmacs
;;     seams to only know the former
;; 2007-12-12  andre-r
;;   * built in XEmacs-compatible code for text properties by Dave Marquardt
;;     (works both in Emacs and XEmacs)
;;   * changed it a bit so that the face for the text property is derived
;;     from another face (hopefully it still works with XEmacs)
;;   * for that purpose created a new, customizable face
;; 2007-09-25  andre-r
;;   * inital release

;; This file is *NOT* part of GNU Emacs.
