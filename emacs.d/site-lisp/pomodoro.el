;;; pomodoro.el --- Pomodoro Technique for emacs

;;; Commentary:

;; The technique is described in http://www.pomodorotechnique.com
;;
;; to start the pomodoro you issue the following command:
;;
;; M-x pomodoro
;;
;; in the modeline you will see the following indicator W1-25. This
;; means that you are working on set 1 and that you have 25 minutes
;; remaining. The counter will decrease each minutes. When it reaches
;; 0 you will get a message in a buffer that it's time to take a
;; break. The modeline will display B1-5, that is you have a break of
;; 5 minutes. When the count reaches 0 you will another message to get
;; back to work and the set number will increase. At the end of the
;; 4th set you will get a long break. The modeline will display LB
;; instead of B.
;;
;; When you don't need the pomodoro anymore you do:
;;
;; M-x pomodoro-stop
;;
;; I you got interrupted and you want to rewind the pomodoro on the
;; current set just do:
;;
;; M-x pomodoro-rewind
;;
;; Calling M-x pomodoro again will reset it to the first working set
;;
;; You can customize this mode with the following variables:
;;  - `pomodoro-work-time' number of minutes of working
;;  - `pomodoro-short-break' number of minutes of a short break
;;  - `pomodoro-long-break' number of minutes of a long break
;;  - `pomodoro-set-number' number of sets until a long break
;;  - `pomodoro-set-number' the minutes of a working set with

;;; THANKS:

;; Obviously Francesco Cirillo for creating the technique. I was
;; inspired by a pomodoro timer for Windows but I can't find out who
;; wrote it...
;; Richard Riley for pointing out I forgot provide
;; Manan Tuli for fixing the modeline and adding a hook

;;; BUGS:

;; Are you kidding me? This software is perfect ;)

;;; INSTALLATION:

;; To activate this package simply put this file in your load path.
;; For example if you put the file is in the directory ~/tmp you need
;; to do the following :
;;
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "~/tmp")
;; (require 'pomodoro)
;;
