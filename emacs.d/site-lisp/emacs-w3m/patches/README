You can apply these patches to the released version of w3m in order to
use some emacs-w3m functions that require the w3m functions under
development.  The patches listed here are lined in new order.

* italic-text.patch

  This patch enables emacs-w3m to display italic text, was posted by
  Hiroyuki Ito <ZXB01226@nifty.com> in [w3m-dev 04185].  Formerly w3m
  simply stripped the <i>...</i> tags in halfdump, so there was no way
  to display italic text by emacs-w3m.


* dot-domain.patch

  This patch was first posted by Ren Lifeng <lfren@cad.zju.edu.cn> in
  [emacs-w3m:08943] and improved by Hiroyuki Ito <ZXB01226@nifty.com>
  in [w3m-dev 04159] afterward.  This enables the cookie to recognize
  that ".namazu.org" is a domain name of the hostname "namazu.org".


* file-progress.patch

  This patch was posted by TSUCHIYA Masatoshi <tsuchiya@namazu.org> in
  [emacs-w3m:05823].  Because w3m that is applied this patch shows size
  of retrieved data asynchronously, this patch enables emacs-w3m to
  display status of retrieving process.
