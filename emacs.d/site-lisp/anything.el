  "The source of candidates for anything.

Attributes:

- name (mandatory)

  The name of the source. It is also the heading which appears
  above the list of matches from the source. Must be unique.

- candidates (mandatory)

  Specifies how to retrieve candidates from the source. It can
  either be a variable name, a function called with no parameters
  or the actual list of candidates.

  The list must be a list of strings, so it's the responsibility
  of the source to convert candidates to strings if necessary.

  If the candidates have to be retrieved asynchronously (for
  example, by an external command which takes a while to run)
  then the function should start the external command
  asynchronously and return the associated process object.
  Anything will take care of managing the process (receiving the
  output from it, killing it if necessary, etc.). The process
  should return candidates matching the current pattern (see
  variable `anything-pattern'.)

  Note that currently results from asynchronous sources appear
  last in the anything buffer regardless of their position in
  `anything-sources'.

- action (mandatory if type attribute is not provided)

  It is a list of (DISPLAY . FUNCTION) pairs. FUNCTION is called
  with one parameter: the selected candidate.

  An action other than the default can be chosen from this list
  of actions for the currently selected candidate (by default
  with TAB). The DISPLAY string is shown in the completions
  buffer and the FUNCTION is invoked when an action is
  selected. The first action of the list is the default.

- type (optional if action attribute is provided)

  Indicates the type of the items the source returns. 

  Merge attributes not specified in the source itself from
  `anything-type-attributes'.

- init (optional)

  Function called with no parameters when anything is started. It
  is useful for collecting current state information which can be
  used to create the list of candidates later.

  For example, if a source needs to work with the current
  directory then it can store its value here, because later
  anything does its job in the minibuffer and in the
  `anything-buffer' and the current directory can be different
  there.

- match (optional)

  List of functions called with one parameter: a candidate. The
  function should return non-nil if the candidate matches the
  current pattern (see variable `anything-pattern').

  This attribute allows the source to override the default
  pattern matching based on `string-match'. It can be used, for
  example, to implement a source for file names and do the
  pattern matching on the basename of files, since it's more
  likely one is typing part of the basename when searching for a
  file, instead of some string anywhere else in its path.

  If the list contains more than one function then the list of
  matching candidates from the source is constructed by appending
  the results after invoking the first function on all the
  potential candidates, then the next function, and so on. The
  matching candidates supplied by the first function appear first
  in the list of results and then results from the other
  functions, respectively.

  This attribute has no effect for asynchronous sources (see
  attribute `candidates'), since they perform pattern matching
  themselves.

- candidate-transformer (optional)

  It's a function called with one argument when the completion
  list from the source is built. The argument is the list of
  candidates retrieved from the source. The function should
  return a transformed list of candidates which will be used for
  the actual completion.

  This can be used to transform or remove items from the list of
  candidates.

  The function can also substitute candidates in the returned
  list with (DISPLAY . REAL) pairs. In this case the DISPLAY
  string is shown in the Anything buffer, but the REAL one is
  used as action argument when the candidate is selected. This
  allows a more readable presentation for candidates which would
  otherwise be, for example, too long or have a common part
  shared with other candidates which can be safely replaced with
  an abbreviated string for display purposes.

  Note that if the (DISPLAY . REAL) form is used then pattern
  matching is done on the displayed string, not on the real
  value.

- filtered-candidate-transformer (optional)

  It has the same format as `candidate-transformer', except the
  function is called with two parameters: the candidate list and
  the source.

  This transformer is run on the candidate list which is already
  filtered by the current pattern. While `candidate-transformer'
  is run only once, it is run every time the input pattern is
  changed.

  It can be used to transform the candidate list dynamically, for
  example, based on the current pattern.

  In some cases it may also be more efficent to perform candidate
  transformation here, instead of with `candidate-transformer'
  even if this transformation is done every time the pattern is
  changed.  For example, if a candidate set is very large then
  `candidate-transformer' transforms every candidate while only
  some of them will actually be dislpayed due to the limit
  imposed by `anything-candidate-number-limit'.

  Note that `candidate-transformer' is run already, so the given
  transformer function should also be able to handle candidates
  with (DISPLAY . REAL) format.

  This option has no effect for asynchronous sources. (Not yet,
  at least.

- action-transformer (optional)

  It's a function called with two arguments when the action list
  from the source is assembled. The first argument is the list of
  actions, the second is the current selection.

  The function should return a transformed action list.

  This can be used to customize the list of actions based on the
  currently selected candidate.

- delayed (optional)

  Candidates from the source are shown only if the user stops
  typing and is idle for `anything-idle-delay' seconds.

- volatile (optional)

  Indicates the source assembles the candidate list dynamically,
  so it shouldn't be cached within a single Anything
  invocation. It is only applicable to synchronous sources,
  because asynchronous sources are not cached.

- requires-pattern (optional)

  If present matches from the source are shown only if the
  pattern is not empty. Optionally, it can have an integer
  parameter specifying the required length of input which is
  useful in case of sources with lots of candidates.")
