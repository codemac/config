(defcustom org-remember-default-headline ""
  "The headline that should be the default location in the notes file.

You can set this on a per-template basis with the variable
`org-remember-templates'."
  :group 'org-remember
  :type 'string)

(defcustom org-remember-templates nil
  "Templates for the creation of remember buffers.
When nil, just let remember make the buffer.
When not nil, this is a list of 5-element lists.  In each entry, the first
element is the name of the template, which should be a single short word.
The second element is a character, a unique key to select this template.
The third element is the template.

The fourth element is optional and can specify a destination file for
remember items created with this template.  The default file is given
by `org-default-notes-file'.  If the file name is not an absolute path,
it will be interpreted relative to `org-directory'.

An optional fifth element can specify the headline in that file that should
be offered first when the user is asked to file the entry.  The default
headline is given in the variable `org-remember-default-headline'.

An optional sixth element specifies the contexts in which the user can
select the template.  This element can be either a list of major modes
or a function.  `org-remember' will first check whether the function
returns `t' or if we are in any of the listed major modes, and select
the template accordingly.

The template specifies the structure of the remember buffer.  It should have
a first line starting with a star, to act as the org-mode headline.
Furthermore, the following %-escapes will be replaced with content:

  %^{prompt}  Prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.
              A default value and a completion table ca be specified like this:
              %^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3|...}
  %t          time stamp, date only
  %T          time stamp with date and time
  %u, %U      like the above, but inactive time stamps
  %^t         like %t, but prompt for date.  Similarly %^T, %^u, %^U
              You may define a prompt like %^{Please specify birthday}t
  %n          user name (taken from `user-full-name')
  %a          annotation, normally the link created with org-store-link
  %i          initial content, the region active.  If %i is indented,
              the entire inserted text will be indented as well.
  %c          content of the clipboard, or current kill ring head
  %^g         prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file
  %^G         prompt for tags, with completion all tags in all agenda files
  %:keyword   specific information for certain link types, see below
  %[pathname] insert the contents of the file given by `pathname'
  %(sexp)     evaluate elisp `(sexp)' and replace with the result
  %!          Store this note immediately after filling the template

  %?          After completing the template, position cursor here.

Apart from these general escapes, you can access information specific to the
link type that is created.  For example, calling `remember' in emails or gnus
will record the author and the subject of the message, which you can access
with %:author and %:subject, respectively.  Here is a complete list of what
is recorded for each link type.

(defun org-remember-handler ()
  "Store stuff from remember.el into an org file.
First prompts for an org file.  If the user just presses return, the value
of `org-default-notes-file' is used.
Then the command offers the headings tree of the selected file in order to
file the text at a specific location.
You can either immediately press RET to get the note appended to the
file, or you can use vertical cursor motion and visibility cycling (TAB) to
find a better place.  Then press RET or <left> or <right> in insert the note.

Key      Cursor position   Note gets inserted
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RET      buffer-start      as level 1 heading at end of file
RET      on headline       as sublevel of the heading at cursor
RET      no heading        at cursor position, level taken from context.
			   Or use prefix arg to specify level manually.
<left>   on headline       as same level, before current heading
<right>  on headline       as same level, after current heading

So the fastest way to store the note is to press RET RET to append it to
the default file.  This way your current train of thought is not
interrupted, in accordance with the principles of remember.el.
You can also get the fast execution without prompting by using
C-u C-c C-c to exit the remember buffer.  See also the variable
`org-remember-store-without-prompt'.

Before being stored away, the function ensures that the text has a
headline, i.e. a first line that starts with a \"*\".  If not, a headline
is constructed from the current date and some additional data.

If the variable `org-adapt-indentation' is non-nil, the entire text is
also indented so that it starts in the same column as the headline
\(i.e. after the stars).

See also the variable `org-reverse-note-order'."
