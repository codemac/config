When a subtree is moved to an archive file, it looses information given by
context, like inherited tags, the category, and possibly also the TODO
state (depending on the variable `org-archive-mark-done').
This variable can be a list of any of the following symbols:

time       The time of archiving.
file       The file where the entry originates.
itags      The local tags, in the headline of the subtree.
ltags      The tags the subtree inherits from further up the hierarchy.
todo       The pre-archive TODO state.
category   The category, taken from file name or #+CATEGORY lines.
olpath     The outline path to the item.  These are all headlines above
           the current item, separated by /, like a file path.

For each symbol present in the list, a property will be created in
the archived entry, with a prefix \"PRE_ARCHIVE_\", to remember this
information."
